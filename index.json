This second part of the series will focus on translating those uplift scores into a policy for determining who should be treated, and on evaluating the performance of uplift models.\nIncremental modeling Uplift modeling is also known as incremental modeling. This terminology stems from the expected output of an uplift model, which is to identify optimal subsets incrementally. An uplift model can be seen as a function that maps subset sizes to instances. For example, if k=1, we expect the model to identify the single individual with the highest propensity for gain. If k=100, we expect the model to identify the top 100 candidates for intervention, and so forth. Hence the notion of incrementality.\nWhy focus on incremental gains rather than intervening across the entire population? In Part 1, we observed that for the Retail Hero data, intervening on everyone should yield a net benefit (this is not always true for every data generating process, but let\u0026rsquo;s assume it is for this discussion). However, there are two main reasons why we should not target everyone:\n  Sleeping dogs:\nSome individuals may respond negatively to treatment, meaning they generate a positive outcome when not treated but would alter their behavior unfavorably under treatment. A good uplift model will identify these individuals and assign them a low uplift score, allowing us to avoid intervening on them.\n  Cost of intervention: Often, interventions carry costs (e.g., time spent on phone calls), and it is more efficient to target only those likely to yield the highest return on investment (ROI). We aim to maximize gain while ensuring costs remain within budget constraints: $\\max \\text{ gain } \\text{s.t. cost} \\leq \\text{budget}$. Many individuals exhibit a net loss, whether they are sure things, lost causes, or sleeping dogs (see the previous post for the customary classification of individual types). This means that if we could predict the potential responses under the two treatment allocations, we could perform much better than a uniform sampling of the population. This is exactly the value proposition of uplift modeling and why an incremental approach is so powerful.\n   Ranking We\u0026rsquo;ve seen that uplift scores estimate the treatment effect for individuals. For example, if CATE (Conditional Average Treatment Effect) = 0.01, it means that intervening adds 0.01 to the probability of responding. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that perfect calibration of these scores is rare and, in fact, not necessary for practical applications.\nWhat really matters in uplift modeling is not the absolute values of the scores, but rather how the model ranks the population. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;re more concerned with whether the model can accurately predict who has a higher treatment effect relative to others, rather than predicting the exact magnitude of those effects.\nFor this reason, a regular step in uplift modeling is to sort the scores in descending order as soon as they come out of the model. This ranking allows us to implement the incremental approach we discussed earlier, targeting individuals with the highest expected uplift first and moving down the list as resources allow.\nThis ranking approach also aligns well with the practical constraints we often face, such as limited budgets for interventions. By focusing on relative rankings rather than absolute scores, we can more easily adjust our targeting strategy to fit within these constraints while still maximizing the overall impact of our interventions.\n The fundamental problem of uplift modeling As we develop uplift models, we\u0026rsquo;re confronted with a critical question: How can we compare the performance of different models? Or, how can we determine if a candidate model shows any benefit over a naive approach, such as random sampling of the population?\nIn traditional machine learning, we would typically use evaluation metrics like accuracy or precision. For uplift modeling, we might be tempted to define an accuracy metric that calculates the proportion of persuadables (those we\u0026rsquo;re trying to identify) from the entire subgroup:\n$$acc_k = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(D,k)} [[Y_i(1)=1]] \\cdot [[Y_i(0)=0]]$$\n Details on notation ⬇️  $\\pi(D,k)$ are the k first instances in dataset $D$ according to the ordering obtained by the uplift model $[[ x ]]$ is the Iverson bracket $Y_i(t)$ is the potential outcome of instance $i$ under treatment $t$   However, there\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental problem: we don\u0026rsquo;t have the ground truth data required to calculate these metrics. The formula above includes both potential outcomes - the response under treatment $Y_i(1)$ and the response under control $Y_i(0)$. But in reality, no individual is both treated and non-treated simultaneously. This is known as the fundamental problem of causal inference.\nHow can we produce reliable evaluations without reliable ground truth data? Remember the assumptions of causal inference from part 1? Have you had a thought along the lines of \u0026ldquo;why on earth do we need to admit ourselves to stringent, unverifiable assumptions?\u0026rdquo; Exactly for this - Let\u0026rsquo;s see how:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) \\mid T = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) \\mid T = 0] \\\n= \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid T = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid T = 0] $$ (The first equation is due to exchangeability, and the second due to consistency)\nThis equation shows that under the causal assumptions, we can use observed quantities to represent unmeasurable concepts like potential outcomes. This is the key that unlocks our ability to evaluate uplift models, despite the fundamental problem of causal inference.\n Evaluation from first principles Our causal assumptions tell us that the treatment and control groups are comparable. This means we can calculate metrics on each treatment group separately and then compare them (often by subtracting). While we can\u0026rsquo;t compute instance-level metrics, we can aggregate over subgroups.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by defining some basic quantities:\n  Number of treated and control instances among the top-k: $$N_\\pi^T(D,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(D,k)}[[t_i=1]]$$ $$N_\\pi^C(D,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(D,k)}[[t_i=0]]$$\n  Number of treated and control responders: $$R_\\pi^T(D,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(D,k)} [[y_i=1]] \\cdot [[t_i=1]]$$ $$R_\\pi^C(D,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(D,k)} [[y_i=1]] \\cdot [[t_i=0]]$$\n  Here, $\\pi(D,k)$ represents the top-k instances in dataset $D$ according to the uplift model\u0026rsquo;s ranking.\nConstructing Uplift Metrics Using these building blocks, we can define several performance metrics. For simplicity, we\u0026rsquo;ll omit $\\pi$ in the following formulas. Here are three common metrics:\n$$(1) \\quad R^T(D,k)-R^C(D,k)\\frac{N^T(D,k)}{N^C(D,k)}$$ $$(2) \\quad (\\frac{R^T(D,k)}{N^T(D,k)}-\\frac{R^C(D,k)}{N^C(D,k)}) \\cdot (N^T(D,k)+N^C(D,k))$$ $$(3) \\quad \\frac{R^T(D,k)}{|T|}-\\frac{R^C(D,k)}{|C|}$$\nWe see many similarities between these metrics. They all compute response rates among the treated group and compare (subtract) them to the control group, with various scaling factors related to group sizes.\nIn the literature, these metrics are known by different names, which can sometimes lead to confusion. The first is usually called a qini curve, and the second is commonly referred to as an uplift curve. It\u0026rsquo;s customary to plot these metrics as a function of $k$, hence the term \u0026ldquo;curve\u0026rdquo; in their names.\nJoint vs Separate Evaluation In the metrics above, the top-k ranked instances include both treated and control groups. This is known as joint evaluation. However, we can also directly compare the highest-scoring treated instances to the highest-scoring controls, which is called separate evaluation. In this setting, we decide how many treated and how many controls are in the evaluation subgroup.\nSeparate evaluation allows us to deliberately address imbalances between treatment arms. We can replace $k \\in {1, \\ldots, N}$ with $p \\in [0,1]$ and use it to scale the group sizes. For example, if $|T|=100$ and $|C|=200$, it makes sense to evaluate the uplift for 10 treatment units and 20 control units, or 30 treatment and 60 control units, and so forth.\nFor separate evaluation, we define: $$R_\\pi(T,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(T,k)} [[y_i=1]]$$ $$R_\\pi(C,k) = \\sum_{i \\in \\pi(C,k)} [[y_i=1]]$$\nThen we can define three more metrics for uplift: $$(4) \\quad R(T,p|T|)-R(C,p|C|)\\frac{|T|}{|C|}$$ $$(5) \\quad \\frac{R(T,p|T|)}{|T|}-\\frac{R(C,p|C|)}{|C|}$$ $$(6) \\quad R(T,p|T|)-R(C,p|C|)$$\nNote that $(4)$ is similar to $(1)$, $(5)$ is similar to $(3)$, and $(6)$ is a bit different in that it does not include any normalization factor.\n Choosing a performance metric How shall we choose a metric that best helps to compare gains from different models? While the uplift modeling literature doesn\u0026rsquo;t always give this topic the attention it deserves, we will try to give motivation or intuition for some of these metrics.\nArea Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC) Before getting into the considerations, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that any curve-based metric can be integrated to give a single scalar value. This is known as the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC): $$AUUC = \\sum_{k=1}^N V(k)$$ Where $V$ is any curve metric we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed. The AUUC can be useful as a benchmark for comparing models, especially when we don\u0026rsquo;t know the specific fraction of the population we plan to target. However, if we do know our intended operating point (i.e., the fraction of the population we\u0026rsquo;ll intervene on), it\u0026rsquo;s often more informative to evaluate the curve at that specific point.\nKey Considerations in Metric Selection  Joint vs. Separate Evaluation:  Joint evaluation (where top-k includes both treated and control) is generally preferable. Reasons to prefer joint evaluation: a) It aligns better with real-world targeting scenarios. b) It avoids potential violations of the exchangeability assumption.\nUnits of Measurement:  Absolute metrics (e.g., metrics $(1)$, $(4)$, and $(6)$) measure \u0026ldquo;How many people will respond to the intervention?\u0026rdquo; Relative metrics (e.g., metrics $(2)$, $(3)$, and $(5)$) measure \u0026ldquo;What fraction of the population can we persuade?\u0026rdquo; The choice between absolute and relative units often depends on organizational preferences and how value is measured within your context.\nRecommended Approach Based on these considerations, here\u0026rsquo;s a suggested approach:\n Start with joint evaluation metrics unless you have a compelling reason for separate evaluation. If you know your intended targeting depth (e.g., top 10% of the population), evaluate the selected curve at that specific point. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know your targeting depth, consider using the are under the curve as a general performance indicator. Choose between absolute and relative units based on what\u0026rsquo;s most meaningful for your specific use case and stakeholders. Always compare your model\u0026rsquo;s performance to a random targeting baseline to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re achieving meaningful gains.   Implementation Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed the theory behind uplift evaluation metrics, let\u0026rsquo;s see how to implement them in practice.\nPreparing the Data Recall from the end of our last post that we had a DataFrame containing the treatment, outcome, and uplift scores: Calculating Joint Metrics Let\u0026rsquo;s start by implementing the joint metrics we discussed earlier:\ndf[\u0026quot;nt\u0026quot;] = (df[\u0026quot;t\u0026quot;] == 1).cumsum() df[\u0026quot;nc\u0026quot;] = (df[\u0026quot;t\u0026quot;] == 0).cumsum() df[\u0026quot;rt\u0026quot;] = ((df[\u0026quot;t\u0026quot;] == 1) \u0026amp; (df[\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;] == 1)).cumsum() df[\u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;] = ((df[\u0026quot;t\u0026quot;] == 0) \u0026amp; (df[\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;] == 1)).cumsum() df[\u0026quot;V1\u0026quot;] = df[\u0026quot;rt\u0026quot;] - (df[\u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;] * df[\u0026quot;nt\u0026quot;] / df[\u0026quot;nc\u0026quot;]) df[\u0026quot;V2\u0026quot;] = ((df[\u0026quot;rt\u0026quot;] / df[\u0026quot;nt\u0026quot;]) - (df[\u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;] / df[\u0026quot;nc\u0026quot;])) * (df[\u0026quot;nt\u0026quot;] + df[\u0026quot;nc\u0026quot;]) df[\u0026quot;V3\u0026quot;] = (df[\u0026quot;rt\u0026quot;] / (df.t == 1).sum()) - (df[\u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;] / (df.t == 0).sum())  Calculating Separate Metrics For the separate setting, we need a bit more preparation:\nsize_control = (df.t == 0).sum() size_treatment = (df.t == 1).sum() grid_control = np.round(np.linspace(0, size_control-1, min(size_control, size_treatment))) grid_treatment = np.round(np.linspace(0, size_treatment-1, min(size_control, size_treatment))) rc_sep = df.loc[df.t == 0, \u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;].reset_index(drop=True).iloc[grid_control].values rt_sep = df.loc[df.t == 1, \u0026quot;rt\u0026quot;].reset_index(drop=True).iloc[grid_treatment].values V4 = rt_sep - rc_sep * (size_treatment / size_control) V5 = rt_sep / size_treatment - rc_sep / size_control V6 = rt_sep - rc_sep  Visualizing the Results Let\u0026rsquo;s visualize one of these metrics, say $V1$ (often called the \u0026lsquo;Qini curve\u0026rsquo;), as a function of the population size: Interpreting this plot:\n The x-axis represents the number of individuals targeted, from 0 to the entire population. The y-axis shows the V1 metric, which represents the incremental number of positive responses due to the treatment. A rising curve indicates that as we target more individuals according to our model\u0026rsquo;s ranking, we continue to see positive uplift.  Cool! But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t help us decide if we should use this model as a targeting policy. To put our model\u0026rsquo;s performance in context, let\u0026rsquo;s compare it to a random targeting policy and an alternative model:\nInterpreting this comparison:  Both the XGBoost T-Learner and Random Forest S-Learner outperform the random policy up to about 75% of the population. The two models show some differences, but they\u0026rsquo;re relatively small and may not be statistically significant. After targeting about 75% of the population, the uplift models' performance converges with the random policy, suggesting diminishing returns for targeting beyond this point.   Summary In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ve explored aspects of evaluating uplift models and translating their outputs into actionable targeting policies. Here are the three key takeaways:\n From Scores to strategy: We discussed why uplift modeling is called incremental modeling and the importance of ranking. Uplift scores are most valuable for their relative ordering rather than absolute values. This ranking allows us to incrementally target individuals, considering factors like intervention costs and potential negative responses (\u0026ldquo;sleeping dogs\u0026rdquo;). The goal is to optimize interventions based on expected impact and available resources. Overcoming the fundamental problem of causal inference: We addressed the challenge of evaluating uplift models when we can\u0026rsquo;t observe both potential outcomes for any individual. Using the assumptions of causal inference, we introduced several evaluation metrics for both joint and separate settings. These metrics allow us to assess model performance despite the inherent limitations of observational data. Practical implementation and comparison: We demonstrated how to implement, visualize and interpret uplift evaluation metrics. We emphasized the need to compare uplift model performance against a random targeting baseline and between different models.  Next Up: Uplift Modeling Beyond RCTs RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) are often considered the gold standard for uplift modeling. However, they can be costly, require significant organizational effort (such as implementing an experimentation platform), and are sometimes simply infeasible. This raises an important question: If we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to data from an RCT, does it mean we can\u0026rsquo;t use uplift modeling at all?\nIn our next post, we\u0026rsquo;ll challenge the commonly held belief that RCTs are an absolute necessity for uplift modeling and explore alternative approaches.

Why does it matter? Grab a seat!\nIn traditional prediction models, the goal is to estimate the likelihood of a particular outcome, such as whether a patient will attend a screening or a customer will remain loyal. However, these models do not reliably estimate the potential impact of specific actions or interventions. This is where uplift modeling comes into play.\nWhat is Uplift Modeling? Uplift modeling, also known as incremental modeling or true lift modeling, focuses on predicting the incremental (more on this later) impact of an intervention. Instead of simply forecasting an outcome, uplift models estimate the difference in outcomes between those who receive the intervention and those who do not. This sounds better than pure prediction models..so why isn\u0026rsquo;t everyone using it? Uplift modelling, being a flavor of causal machine learning, is more complex than simple prediction. It comes with a high entry barrier: we need detailed knowledge about how the data was generated. These requirements are known as the assumptions of causal inference, which will detailed next.\nRequirements for causal inference Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA): The effect of intervention on one individual should not influence the effect on another individual. For example, if a participant in a marketing study shares their positive experience with a targeted product with another participant, and this influences the second participant’s decision to try the product, then SUTVA is violated.\nExchangeability: All factors that influence both the treatment assignment and the outcome should be observed and accounted for in the model. To demonstrate, consider the following scenario in a hospital: We observe that every patient who receives a certain medication ends up dying. If we assume that the two treatment groups are comparable, we could conclude that the medication is causing these death. But this is likely not the case - maybe there are additional factors, such as the fact that doctors prescribe this medication only to the most critically ill patients, for whom all other treatments have failed. If we account for the severity of the patients' conditions (and all other factors influencing the decision to treat and the outcome), then we can assume that both groups are exchangeable, hence comparable. And if we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to these factors, then exchangeability is violated. This assumption is also called uncondoundedness or ignorability.\nPositivity: Every individual in the data should have a chance (a positive probability, hence the name) of receiving each treatment. If only patients above the age of 50 are eligible for a certain drug, then positivity is violated and we can\u0026rsquo;t infer its effect on the young population. This assumption is also called overlap or common support, in the sense that the whole population has a shared range of characteristics across treatment groups.\nThere are two more assumptions that are prerequisites for uplift modeling: consistency, which means the treatment effect we observe should match the true treatment effect for each individual, and the absence of hidden variations in the treatment. These assumptions are straightforward and are generally less challenging to address.\nRCTs satisfy causal requirements We see that causal modeling in general and uplift modeling specifically demand a high price before we even start working. Among the requirements, the hardest to satisfy in most cases is the exchangeability assumption. It is unverifiable from data alone, meaning we cannot look at the data and inspect if it holds or not. We need external information about how the data was generated. To demonstrate, see the example in this post where two different processes create an identical distribution for $P(X,Y)$. If we know the data was generated from an RCT, where treatment was randomly allocated, then exchangeability holds because no factors influence both treatment assignment and outcome. Without control over the treatment assignment process, we can never know that we have hold of all factors influencing it, and we cannot guarantee exchangeability.\nThe modern practice of uplift modelling relies heavily on the availability of randomized data. In fact, data from an RCT is often considered a requirement for uplift modeling. Randomized data also ensures positivity, as the treatment groups have identical feature distributions $P(X∣T=0)=P(X∣T=1)$ (assuming a sufficiently large sample size relative to the feature vector\u0026rsquo;s cardinality). As for SUTVA, randomized data does not guarantee it, and we need subject-matter knowledge to address it.\nAs we know from the clinical domain, RCTs are costly and often impractical. Can we perform uplift modelling without randomized data? We\u0026rsquo;ll explore this question in Part III of this series. For now, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the industry standard of using randomized data.\nPractice After reviewing the requirements, let\u0026rsquo;s practice some uplift modeling. The basic recipe has just two steps:\n Causal modeling: Train a model that generates estimates of individual-level treatment effects, also called uplift scores in the context of uplift modeling. Evaluation and decision-making: Use the causal model to define a policy for determining whom to treat.  The remainder of this post will focus on the first step, and the next post will handle the evaluation step.\nData The data we\u0026rsquo;ll be using is the Retail Hero competition dataset, preprocessed according to Juan Orduz\u0026rsquo;s suggestion. The processed version is available to download from here.\nSome key properties about this dataset:\n It is an RCT - treatment is randomly assigned The treatment is being contacted by the retail company The target is the user making a transaction The treatment is almost perfectly balanced between intervention and control (50%/50%), though this is not required for valid uplift modelling. The average response rate among the treated individuals is 63.7%, while for the control group, it is 60.4%. Since this is an RCT, we can infer that the average treatment effect, which is also called the total uplift, is around 3.3%:  data_df.groupby(treatment_col)[target_col].mean().diff()[1]  This means that if we had intervened upon the entire population, we could have expected an extra 3% in purchases compared to contacting no one at all.\nModeling To develop an intuition for the modeling approach, let\u0026rsquo;s clearly define its objective. In uplift modeling, we aim to identify and separate individuals who would be positively affected by the treatment from those who would not be. More specifically, we can categorize individuals into four types based on their responses to different treatments:\n Would respond positively regardless of whether they receive the treatment. Would not respond regardless of the treatment. Would respond positively only if they receive the treatment. Would respond positively only if they do not receive the treatment.  Each of these types has specific terminology in the uplift modeling domain, and they are usually presented in a contingency table format, such as this one from Dataiku: So our goal is to identify the persuadables with high precision. Targeting the sleeping dogs is the worst case because it leads to a loss in whatever we are optimizing (revenue, number of cancer screening tests, etc.). Additionally, targeting the lost causes and the sure things is also unwanted, as the intervention itself usually has a cost (such as placing a phone call). Therefore, a useful model will generate persuadability scores, which we can use to target the individuals with the highest scores.\nT-learner To achieve this, we can build two models: one for each treatment group. One model will predict the potential outcome if an individual is treated, and the other will predict the potential outcome if not treated. By subtracting the predictions of the two models, we arrive at the persuadability score. This score, also known as the uplift score, helps us determine who is most likely to benefit from the treatment.\n$$\\widehat{uplift}(x) = \\mu _T (x) - \\mu _C (x)$$\nThis modeling choice is called a T-learner, where \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo; stands for \u0026ldquo;two\u0026rdquo; because it involves two models. It is a flexible and powerful meta-model, allowing the practitioner to choose any base classifier, from a simple logistic regression to a deep learning model. If the individuals' responses were precisely predictable from the data, we would expect the following:\n The persuadables would have uplift scores close to 1 The lost causes and sure things would have uplift scores close to 0 The sleeping dogs would have uplift scores close to -1  There are many great open source python packages that implement meta-learners for causal inference and uplift modeling, causalml and scikit-uplift are two examples. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll implement the model from scratch to demonstrate how simple and intuitive it is:\nimport pandas as pd from pathlib import Path from xgboost.sklearn import XGBClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split src_dir = Path().cwd() data_dir = src_dir.parent / \u0026quot;data\u0026quot; data_df = pd.read_csv(data_dir / 'retailhero-uplift' / 'data' / \u0026quot;processed_data.csv\u0026quot;)  y = data_df.target t = data_df.treatment_flg x = data_df.drop(columns=[\u0026quot;treatment_flg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;target\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;client_id\u0026quot;]) idx_train, idx_val = train_test_split( data_df.index, test_size=0.3, random_state=17, stratify=(y.astype(str) + \u0026quot;_\u0026quot; + t.astype(str)), ) x_train = x.loc[idx_train] x_val = x.loc[idx_val] t_train = t.loc[idx_train] t_val = t.loc[idx_val] y_train = y.loc[idx_train] y_val = y.loc[idx_val]  model_treatment, model_control = XGBClassifier(), XGBClassifier() model_treatment.fit(x_train[t_train == 1], y_train[t_train == 1]) model_control.fit(x_train[t_train == 0], y_train[t_train == 0]) uplift_scores = (model_treatment.predict_proba(x_val) - model_control.predict_proba(x_val))[:, 1] df = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;: y_val, \u0026quot;t\u0026quot;: t_val, \u0026quot;uplift_score\u0026quot;: uplift_scores.flatten()})  df.sort_values(\u0026quot;uplift_score\u0026quot;).head()  Other modelling approaches In this post we have chosen the T-learner as causal model, but there are many other good choices. Two notable example are:\n Transformed outcome model: This method transforms the problem into a single regression task by adjusting the observed outcomes, allowing standard regression techniques to estimate treatment effects directly. End to end modeling: Though we haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about evaluation of uplift models yet, we can already guess that the base model\u0026rsquo;s loss function (cross entropy or some other classification loss) might not be best aligned with what we care about in uplift modeling. Some methods try to directly optimize uplift metrics, aiming to align the model\u0026rsquo;s training process more closely with the goal of maximizing uplift. However, these methods are often not used in practice due to their complexity and computational demands.  Summary That\u0026rsquo;s a wrap for part I! Let\u0026rsquo;s summarize what we\u0026rsquo;ve covered so far:\n Uplift models are used to create individual-level targeting policies.

While I wish I read books, I just can\u0026rsquo;t prioritize it high enough, and apart from professional material, the only reading I do is food blogs. I love David Lebovitz for the french drinks and apéros, and Green Kitchen Stories for healthy, kid friendly (Yaar loves these muffins) recipes. In Hebrew, I check Ptitim, Limor Tiroche and Michal Waxman on a weekly basis and read every word in every post.\nBut above all these, my favorite food blog is Smitten Kitchen. My metric here (we\u0026rsquo;re in a quantitative field after all) is the total number of recipes made. This proxy may be skewed by ultra-recurrent recipes (like the oatmeal pancakes I make every Saturday morning for the last ~18 months), but it\u0026rsquo;s still a useful metric.\nHaving wanted to play around with web scraping and parsing, I thought it would be a fun weekend project to build a popularity prediction model for Smitten Kitchen recipes.\n Dataset Beautiful Soup helped with basic parsing, on top of which specific features like the publish date, categories, post title, introduction and the recipe itself were extracted. The number of comments was defined as the measure of recipe popularity (more on this decision in the last section).\nThe resulting dataset (not showing the category column) has 505 recipes and looks like this: As can be expected, the number of comments is heavy tailed. But this tail is rather fat - the standard deviation is almost as large as the median:  Setting the baseline RMSE on the test set (~100 recipes) was chosen as the evaluation criteria for all models.\nA useful baseline for regression tasks is simply to predict the target\u0026rsquo;s mean. This yields an RMSE of 202, a bit higher than the target\u0026rsquo;s STD (due to train/test sample variability).\nIt couldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard to beat this error, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s see..\n Recipe Categories Each recipe has a few categories (tags) - an average of 5 per blog entry. The most prevalent are vegetarian, summer, breakfast, cake, salad and weeknight favorite. The 184 categories were encoded as bits and passed to a CatBoost model with default parameters. The RMSE decreased to 194 - quite underwhelming.\n The Direction of Time Time is a significant predictor of popularity, especially in the early days of the site.\nUsing the annual means from the train set as an estimator for recipe popularity yields an RMSE of 181 - now we\u0026rsquo;re getting somewhere!\n Incorporating free text The dataset includes three fields of free text: post title, an introduction and the recipe itself.\n Sentence Transformers provides a convenient API for encoding chunks of text, but they don\u0026rsquo;t play nicely with scikit-learn pipelines. Recently I came across a compact library called Embetter which does just that - a scikit-learn compatible interface for sentence transformers. It also has an interface over timm for image use cases. With Embetter, predicting a target from text is as easy as:\npipe = make_pipeline(ColumnGrabber(\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;), SentenceEncoder('all-MiniLM-L6-v2'), RandomForestRegressor()) pipe.fit(df_train, df_train.n_comments) mean_squared_error(df_val.n_comments, pipe.predict(df_val), squared=False)  After some experiments, I settled on the following pipeline:\nEmbedding the other text fields did not add predictive power. Applying PCA and using other regressors just made things worse. The RMSE for this setup was 174 - only slightly better than using the year alone. Meh.\n Closing thoughts While this was a lot of fun, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but feel a bit disappointed in failing to predict recipe popularity. The thing is, I equated popularity with the number of comments. But it\u0026rsquo;s a mere proxy for popularity. And as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a previous post, this has implications for the feasibility and usability of the models built upon it.\n Takeaways  This is a fabulous dessert.

Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s a case of overfitting, but there was a disagreement among my peers if this was a bad thing or not. After all, it was better than models that did not exhibit a train-test gap (e.g. logistic regression). But still I was not able to convince that test performance is all that should matter. So I had a little literature review, and presented it in our weekly journal club. This post is a summary of that presentation.\n Intro Every intro to ML course or textbook teaches us the bias variance tradeoff as universal truth - that test error curve follows a U-shape with respect to model complexity.\n “This is a fundamental property of statistical learning that holds regardless of the particular data set at hand and regardless of the statistical method being used.”\n Quote and figure from ISLRv2, 2021\nYet everywhere around us we see evidence that “bigger models are always better”  1, 2\nHow do we relieve this tension? Is it just the difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning? Is the tradeoff real at all? Let’s take a stab at settling this.\n The Defense On the one hand, there is empirical grounding for the tradeoff - it can be shown to exist in models like KNN, polynomial regression, kernel regression, decision trees and more.\nThere is some theoretical justification for it too. Generalization bounds that grow with complexity (VC/Rademacher) are interpreted as if simple models are preferable.\n “In real applications, learning models with lower VC(H) tend to generalize better”, Learning From Data, 2021\n As an ML history fun fact, the tradeoff was not popularized until the 1992 paper “Neural Networks and the Bias/Variance Dilemma” by Geman et. al. This same paper also introduced the decomposition of the MSE to bias and variance components. As the decomposition is usually discussed in the same context, it adds to the strong intuition of the tradeoff (even though it does not imply it).\n The Cracks The empirical and theoretical arguments seem fair, but let\u0026rsquo;s see if they stand up to some scrutiny.\nAs far back as 95’ there have been works showing that variance remains low for models with increasing complexity. Curiously, inconsistencies between classical and neural models are demonstrated even in the 92' paper that popularized the tradeoff:\nbut the authors dismiss them as related to the training procedure and not a fundamental property of the model class.\nAs for the generalization bounds, they are too loose to accurately reflect the test error’s trend in practice.\nWhile these were not sufficient to change the community’s opinion on the tradeoff, it seems that the tide has started to shift in the last 4 years. In 2019 Mikhail Belkin and colleagues coined double descent to describe a fairly prevalent phenomenon where the standard bias-variance picture breaks down once zero training error is attained - what they call the interpolation threshold. Before the interpolation threshold, the tradeoff holds and increasing model complexity leads to overfitting. After the interpolation threshold, however, they found that test error actually starts to go down as you keep increasing model complexity. This is shown for fully connected networks, random forest and a random fourier feature model.\nConcurrent work by Nakkiran et al. has proved that double descent w.r.t model width is a robust phenomenon that occurs in a variety of tasks, architectures (CNNs, ResNets, Transformers), and optimization methods.\nBut more interesting is the phenomenon of training time double descent - training for more epochs decreases performance (before improving again),\nAnd dataset size double descent - using more training samples (x4.5 more in their experiments) decreases performance before improving again.\nIn some experiments, a single descent (rather than double descent) was observed. But a U-shaped loss curve was never observed for neural nets! Which aligns with the modern practice of “bigger is better”.\n Reconciling theory and practice There are some suggestive explanations for this deflection between theory and practice. Many revolve around the notion of complexity - that we just don’t have a proper measure of it. One for which larger models could actually be simpler. Regardless of whether you accept one of the hypotheses, you can’t argue with the science. After all, theory is subordinate to science, as this great talk by Tom Goldstein calls for.\n Brady Neal’s work on this very subject is subtitled “Textbooks need an update”. And indeed recent books include double descent in their discussion of the bias variance tradeoff. Examples include ISLRv2, LTFP and ML Story.\nStill, more effort should be put in teaching that the bias variance tradeoff is not a universal truth, at least based on the measures of complexity we use in our everyday practice. This has implications on how we select and evaluate ML models.\nAs a personal note, what’s still missing for me is a rule of thumb for determining if some case of overfitting (train error \u0026laquo; test error) is benign, or should it suggest that a different model should be selected.\n ","date":1658733222,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658733222,"objectID":"da7b799d78205a556799d4a8f5040d7a","permalink":"https://tom-beer.github.io/post/revisiting_bias_variance/","publishdate":"2022-07-25T10:13:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/revisiting_bias_variance/","section":"post","summary":"A classical principle in modern times","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting the bias variance tradeoff","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"After reviewing the implications of using proxy variables in the context of causal inference, this post will provide a similar review for the context of prediction models. This post uses three short stories that demonstrate the problem, with a discussion following.\n A Riddle Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a riddle, presented in MO (2017). It goes like this:\nYou are given a risk score model for stroke prior to it being deployed in a hospital\u0026rsquo;s ER for the purpose of triaging patients. This is an important task as symptoms might be subtle for life-threatening conditions like stroke.\nThe training data consists of ~200K visits to the ER of the said hospital. The predictors used are demographic data and also any prior diagnoses present in the EHR system over the year before the ER visit. The label is a diagnosis of stroke in the week of the ER visit, and the task is modelled using logistic regression.\nThe reported PPV and other metrics seem great, but being a good data scientist you decide to look at the top predictors for future stroke. Since this is a linear model without interaction terms, the top coefficients might be sufficient for gaining some insight into the model. You see the following:\nPrior stroke – that’s expected. CVD history – makes sense. But accidental injury? Colonoscopy? Sinusitis? How can these increase the likelihood of stroke? What’s happening here? Did the model uncover new risk factors for stroke, unknown to the medical literature?\n The Answer To figure this out, it’s useful to understand what we are actually predicting here, because it surely isn’t just stroke. We are not predicting biological stroke, but the presence of a billing code or a doctor\u0026rsquo;s note indicating stroke. There is a vast difference between the two. For a stroke to be recorded in the data, a patient has to have stroke-like symptoms, decide to seek medical care, get tested and diagnosed with stroke. Meaning the model predicts a patient’s propensity to seek care just as much as it predicts stroke. In other words, stroke measured in the data is the combination of real biological stroke with heavy utilization of the medical system. Would we want this model deployed? Of course not.\n Story 2: chronic conditions The stroke model was trained (from real data) to prove a point, but it was not intended to be deployed at any time. The second story is about a model that was actually used to generate predictions at a massive scale - for about 70 million Americans each year. Chronically ill patients receive poor healthcare, so algorithms are used extensively in attempt to target patients into ‘high risk management' programs. The motivation is to anticipate which patients are at risk for hospitalization, disease flare up, mortality etc., and then intervene to prevent these. Unfortunately, this algorithm was racially biased (this was subsequently fixed with the help of the researchers that uncovered the bias).\nThe decision process goes like this. The model generates a risk score, and then the top 2% of risk scores are enrolled to the high risk program. The bias can be seen as easily as plotting the risk score percentile against the comorbidity score (stratified by race).\nWe see that or each predicted risk score percentile, Blacks have more active chronic illnesses. How did this bias come about? The model attempted to predict healthcare needs, and used medical expenditure as the prediction target. But Blacks and Whites have different relations between health status and cost (due to many reasons). In short, Black patients cost less conditional on health. Equating expenditure and healthcare needs generated this disparity. This story was uncovered by OPV (2019).\n Story 3: Knee Pain Pain in general is concentrated in society’s most disadvantaged. For example, Blacks report pain twice as frequent compared to other ethnicities. Knee pain is one condition where these disparities are present. The routine treatment protocol for knee pain is to have an X-ray evaluated by a radiologist. Osteoarthritis severity is measured from the X-ray based on standard scores like the Kellgren–Lawrence grade. Then the patient is commonly referred to either knee replacement surgery or physiotherapy.\nUnfortunately, it has been shown many times that pain disparities remain even when adjusting for radiographic osteoarthritis severity (KLG) - Black, lower income and lower education patients have more pain at every level of X-ray graded disease severity.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. Why are radiologists not able to see pain the same for all people? Because radiographic severity is not a credible predictor for pain. This might have to do with the fact that KLG was developed in the 50s on White British males, while being applied today on the whole population, as discussed in PCL+ (2021).\n Tying it up The recurring theme in all three failure cases is unintended implications of using proxy variables in predictive modelling. In the first case, stroke recorded in the ER data was a proxy for stroke in the general population. In the second case, medical expenditure was a proxy for healthcare needs. And in the third, the radiologist’s diagnostic label was a proxy for the true underlying pain.\nIf we think about it, these examples are not exceptions. In most predictive tasks, we are interested in modelling unobservable theoretical constructs, like socioeconomic status, patient health, teacher effectiveness etc. Because these constructs cannot be observed, they cannot be measured directly. Instead, they must be inferred from measurements of observable properties. Collapsing the distinction between unobservable constructs and observed data might cause adverse implications, while acknowledging this gap is the best thing we can do to anticipate (and maybe mitigate) these implications.\n Further reading The theory of measurement modelling formalizes a statistical model between the latent construct and its measured proxies. This work is a great read on the topic.\nAside from fairness related harms like discussed here, when using proxies we can expect a mismatch between the predictive task and the real world objective. This might also lead to misleading evaluation of the model -see this great talk.\nEver seen claims of superhuman medical performance? It is likely because the model performs a proxy for the real medical task, see for example the discussion here.\n Takeaway Proxy variables and proxy tasks have broad implications for the utility and fairness of the models in which they are used. By making explicit the gap between the objective and its proxy, we might be able to build better ML systems.\n","date":1651130022,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651130022,"objectID":"17f8268ab38693870721282820057c93","permalink":"https://tom-beer.github.io/post/proxies_ml/","publishdate":"2022-04-28T10:13:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/proxies_ml/","section":"post","summary":"Part 2: Prediction models","tags":[],"title":"On the Hazards of Proxies II","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This post introduces the framework of rejection learning with applications to algorithmic automation problems.\nResponsible Prediction In high stakes domains like healthcare, machine learning systems must exhibit some sort of accountability and sensibility for them to be safely deployed. While it is still a difficult and ill-defined task, there are many approaches to making prediction models behave responsibly. For example, we can manipulate the raw model outputs, to make sure that it alligns with a predefined set of rules. Another example is to defer the decision to a simpler model, like a medical protocol.\nUsing a rejection mechanism is one aspect often neglected in the design of prediction models. When a model has the ability to abstain from making a prediction, the resulting system is expected to be a lot more sensible. In healthcare, this would mean models that are safer, better performing, and trusted by physicians.\n Automation $\\neq$ Prediction The main motivation for rejection learning is algorithmic automation. Many actionable prediction tasks are actually automation problems – we want to replace human effort with algorithms.\nWe tend to equate prediction and automation, but by doing that we miss out on challenges and opportunities that arise from the differences between the two problems:\nSince automation builds upon the stable ground of humans performing a task, in most applications there\u0026rsquo;s no requirement that all instances be automated by the algorithm. Unlike prediction problems that do not build upon humans performing a task, here applying automation to any fraction of the population has a significant potential for impact. Thus algorithmic automation is more than just the replacement of human effort - it also includes the meta decision of which instances to automate. A great overview of this topic is available here.\n Classification with Rejection In rejection learning, we extend the multiclass output space $\\mathcal{Y}= \\{ 1,\\ldots,K\\}$ to include $\\circledR$ which denotes rejection. In ordinary classification we use the usual zero-one loss $\\ell_{01}(f(\\boldsymbol{x}), y)=\\mathbb{1}_{[f(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\neq y]}$, and in rejection learning we use an extension of it \u0026ndash; the zero-one-c loss:\n$$ \\ell_{01c}(f(\\boldsymbol{x}), y) = \\begin{cases} c \u0026amp; f(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\circledR \\ \\newline \\ell_{01}(f(\\boldsymbol{x}), y) \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThis loss funcion means that we pay a cost of $c$ if we choose to reject the instance, and otherwise pay a cost of $1$ for a missclassification.\n Optimal Classifier The optimal solution for a function minimizing the expected risk w.r.t $\\ell_{01c}$ was formulated backn in the 1950s by Chow: $$ f^*(x) = \\begin{cases} \\circledR \u0026amp; \\text{max}_y \\text{ }P(y|x) \\le 1-c \\ \\newline \\text{argmax}_y \\text{ }P(y|x) \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThis classification rule dicatates that we should reject an instance if the posterior probabilities for all $K$ classes are smaller than $1-c$.\n Determining the rejection cost $c$ The cost of rejection is a hyperparameter we need to set before learning a classification rule. A larger cost means that more instances are rejected, so it should be set by considering a tradeoff between the coverage rate (the fraction of accepted cases) and cost of missclassification.\nA discussion on this tradeoff follows towards the end of the post, but a rule of thumb applicable for any task is this: $c$ should be smaller than the cost induced by a random guess (otherwise we would obtain an unhelpful, trivial classifier). Assuming the classes are balanced, this rule of thumb implies that:\n$$ c \\in \\bigg(0, \\frac{K-1}{K}\\bigg), $$\nand in the general case of imbalanced data, $c$ should be smaller than one minus the smallest class size.\n Two approaches How can we learn a classification with rejection rule? The literature describes two possible approaches.\nFirst is the confidence approach. Chow’s optimal rule suggests that classification with rejection is solved if we know the posterior distributions of the classes given the data. Hence the confidence approach is a straightforward solution: train a classifier and use the output of the classifier as a confidence score, drawing inferences by substituting the confidence scores in Chow\u0026rsquo;s rule. The main drawback here is that reliabely estimating class-posterior probabilities is difficult (to say the least). For example, neural networks are notoriously known for their overconfident scores.\nSecond is the classifier-rejector approach. If we take another look at Chow\u0026rsquo;s rule, we can rewrite it as two functions:\n$$ r^*(x) = \\text{max}_y \\text{ }P(y|x) - (1-c) $$\n$$ h^*(x) = \\text{argmax}_y \\text{ }P(y|x) $$\nwhere $h(x)$ is an ordinary classifier and $r(x)$ is a rejector, rejecting instances if it\u0026rsquo;s value is negative. This formulation suggests that a classification rule could be obtained by learning two independent functions. Apart from a neat logical separation, this approach is more flexible compared to the confidence approach. For example, different hypotheses spaces could be used to model the classifier and rejector. A simple illustration for the increased flexibility of the classifier-rejector approach was brought in this paper \u0026ndash; for the case of linear models, only decoupling between the classifier and rejector can solve this data:\nMany heuristics fit in this approach – for example, we can use an outlier detection algorithm to reject some instances, and learn a classifier independently.\n Theoretical Guarantees Over the years, many solutions of both approaches have been proposed for the problem of learning with rejection. Unfortunately, none of them were able to show theoretical justifications for the muliclass case \u0026ndash; only for binary classification.\nThe reason for this is that it is hard to satisfy calibration for the learned classifier, which is required in order to say something about the classifier\u0026rsquo;s behaviour. This point is discussed in detail here.\n Cost sensitive learning A notable exception in the multiclass case is this work, which managed to propose a theroetically sound solution for this problem. The authors use the framework of cost sensitive learning to derive a learning rule. Cost sensitive learning allows to assign weights to the different missclassification errors. For the binary case, a cost sensitive loss function would look like this:\n$$ l_{01}^\\alpha(f(x), y)=\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{[f(x) \\neq y=-1]} + (1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{[f(x)=y=+1]} $$\nAnd the optimal classification rule for with respect to this loss is:\n$$ f_\\alpha^*(x) = \\begin{cases} +1 \u0026amp; P(y=+1|x) \\gt \\alpha \\ \\newline -1 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nA key observation in this work is that the problem of learning with rejection could be reduced to an instance of cost sensitive learning using the following rule:\n$$ f^*(x) = \\begin{cases} +1 \u0026amp; f_{1-c}^*(x) = +1 \\ \\newline -1 \u0026amp; f_{c}^*(x) = -1 \\ \\newline \\circledR \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nWhere we replace the $\\alpha$ parameter of cost senstive learning with $c$ and $1-c$ of the rejection framework.\nSimilarily, to extend this rule to the more interesting case of multiclass classification, we can use this reduction:\n$$ f^*(x) = \\begin{cases} \\circledR \u0026amp; \\max_y f_{1-c}^{*,y}(x) = -1 \\ \\newline \\text{argmax}_y f_{1-c}^{*,y}(x) \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nWhere the classifiers $f^{*,y}(x)$ denote a one-versus-rest classification for the class $y$. This rule is equivalent to Chow\u0026rsquo;s rule, thus this reduction implies that we can learn a cost sensitive classifier to solve the rejection learning problem. Further details, including learning and inference rules are brought in this work, but they will not be covered here.\n Accuracy-rejection curves Just like ordinary classification where we have to strike a tradeoff between the different errors, or optimize a predefined balance between them (e.g. F1 score or AUROC), in rejection learning we need to decide about the balance between some measure of performance (e.g. accuracy) and the coverage rate. The higher the required performance, the lower the achievable coverage rate.\nAccuracy-rejection curves, introduced here, are a convenient visualization tool to aid in this decision. These plots are easily understood by stakeholders, and can serve as basis for discussion with them. In addition, accuracy-rejection curves allow to compare different models throughout the coverage axis.\nAn interesting point to mention is that practitioners often believe that the better the model at classifying the whole population (without rejection), the better it would be for any non-zero rejection rate. But this is not true, and it is important to compare models on the whole spectrum of rejection. Accuracy-rejection curves can highlight this non-monotonic behaviour.\n Summary Classification with rejection is a very useful framework when applying prediction models to automation problems. I have a feeling that it is either underutilized, or used but without the proper framing and tooling discussed here. Practitioners may apply some hard-coded filters to reject error-prone cases, but they usually won\u0026rsquo;t use an algorithm to decide which instances to accpet or reject. In the few cases of using a model for rejection, it would probably be some simple hueristic like an outlier detector or using the raw output scores of the classifer. I believe that a proper adoption of this framework would greatly benefit algorithmic automation problems, and I hope to see it receive more attention in the upcoming years.\n","date":1621408422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621408422,"objectID":"03eb946b36031a70ce769720a0c37a66","permalink":"https://tom-beer.github.io/post/reject/","publishdate":"2021-05-19T10:13:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/reject/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Responsible Automation by Learning to Reject","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This is part one (of at least two) posts about the hazards of using proxy variables in statistical/ML models. Proxy variables are pervasive in almost every data-driven analysis. Part one will focus on the case of observational causal inference, where the main harm is severe bias of the treatment effect estimates.\n Confounding Confounding is one of the fundamental challenge to identifying and estimating causal effects. It is a fundamental challenge because the condition of unconfoundedness (sometimes termed ignorability), which is a prerequisite for causal inference, is unverifiable from the data alone. Meaning the observed distribution can be explained by many different data generating processes (DGPs). For a simple illustration, consider the following two DGPs (created by David Lopez Paz):\nx = np.randn(N) y = 0.701 * (x + np.randn(N))  z = 0.8410 * np.randn(N) x = z + 0.5412 * np.randn(N) y = z + 0.5412 * np.randn(N)  In both cases, the observed distribution $P(X,Y)$ is identical. Yet in the second case, without measuring $z$ and accounting for it, we might be misled to think that $x$ and $y$ have a causal effect on one another. The challenge is that we would never be able to know for sure that all confounders were measured and collected. This challenge leads many practitioners to collect and account for as many variables as they possible can - a \u0026lsquo;throw in the kitchen sink\u0026rsquo; approach.\n Proxies of confounders That\u0026rsquo;s good in theory. But in most real-world observational studies, true ignorability of the treatment assignment doesn’t hold, because we can’t accurately measure all possible confounders. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to measure socioeconomic status (SES) because it potentially confounds the effect of red wine intake on the risk for CVD. But what is SES anyway? It’s an abstract concept, never to be measured directly. Same goes for intelligence, or health.\nLuckily we may have access to proxies for these constructs. E.g. ZIP code, years of education or income for SES, IQ test score for intelligence and BMI, blood tests for health status etc. Proxies are everywhere! It can even be argued that all variables are proxies for the latent constructs we would have wanted to measure.\n Using proxy variables How should one use a proxy variable in a causal analysis? Should we control (adjust) for them, or not? Technically they’re not confounders, because they don’t lie on a backdoor path between treatment and outcome. The following is a graphical representation for a proxy of a confounder.\nOn the other hand, these proxies are associated with the unmeasured confounders, and so may indirectly adjust for some of the confounding bias. The widespread common practice, whether intentionally acknowledging the covariates as proxies or not, is to use them just like true confounders. For example, a recent textbook (highly recommended!) states that it is typically preferable to adjust, rather than not to adjust, for confounder proxies.\n Residual confounding What are the implications for this analysis choice? Confounding bias will not be eliminated, no matter how many proxies we gather and irrespective of sample size! To demonstrate this phenomenon of residual confounding, consider the above DAG with $X = U + noise$ for increasing noise intensity. The following is an illustration of the observed data, and the title contains the noise intensity and estimated average treatment effect (ATE).\nThe true causal effect is constant and equals to 1. The confounding is significant: without considering $X$, the average associational difference between treatment groups is about 2.4. When $X$ is accurately measured (setting $\\sigma=0$), the causal effect is consistently estimated from data (up to finite sample errors; low sample size was chosen for visibility). But with measurement error, the ATE estimate is biased. The corruption mechanism is the infamous attenuation bias. Unlike simple attenuation bias which always shrinks the regression coefficient towards zero, the bias in ATE estimation can go either way, depending on the data generating process.\n More details for the above simulation Consider the following DGP: a one-dimensional latent (unobserved) confounder $U$ generates noisy measurements $X$. The treatment $T$ is assigned according to the latent confounder and the outcome $Y$ is a function of the treatment and the latent confounder. The specific dependency structure of this DGP is given below.\n\\begin{align*} U \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) \\end{align*} \\begin{align*} X \\mid U \\sim \\mathcal{N}(U,\\sigma) \\end{align*} \\begin{align*} T \\mid U \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\text{Sigmoid}(2.5 \\cdot U)) \\end{align*} \\begin{align*} Y \\mid U,T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(U+T,1) \\end{align*}\n  In the limit of infinite variance for the measured covariates' noise, the estimated causal effect would converge to the associative difference between treatment groups, as the covariates would lose all information they hold.\n Prevalence and mitigation To what extent does this issue impact empirical causal inference analyses \u0026ndash; what is its prevalence and magnitude? It is hard to know. A few studies tried to shed light on this by measuring potential confounders and proxies for these variables, like in this work. Other studies managed to show that attenuation bias did indeed occur, like in this work.\nSome works have attempted to find solutions for this obstacle, dating back to the beginning of the previous century, but this has proved to be a challenging task. Suggested methods either require stringent assumptions or offer no guarantees on the quality of the solution. Notable examples are works using matrix factorization and deep learning.\n Summary and implications Residual confounding bias due to the use of proxy variables is a significant obstacle in non-experimental causal inference. Its implications are potentially severe, as the bias could vary in sign and magnitude, making causal effect estimates unreliable. Due to both the limitations of the proposed solutions and an inadequate awareness of the harms described here, the present state of empirical practice is unsatisfactory - none of the proposed methods have gained adoption by practitioners, who continue to produce error-prone analyses.\n","date":1614100422,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614100422,"objectID":"cd30cf11bcef4c9c7397d904ae902f10","permalink":"https://tom-beer.github.io/post/proxies_ci/","publishdate":"2021-02-23T20:13:42+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/proxies_ci/","section":"post","summary":"Part 1: Causal Inference","tags":[],"title":"On the Hazards of Proxies I","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tom Beer","Bar Eini-Porat","Sebastian Goodfellow","Danny Eytan","Uri Shalit"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598468077,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598468077,"objectID":"8db09040d6d4212d3fbc3cad69d21316","permalink":"https://tom-beer.github.io/publication/discovery/","publishdate":"2020-08-26T21:54:37+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/discovery/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown remarkable success in the classification of physiological signals. In this study we propose a method for examining to what extent does a DNN's performance rely on rediscovering existing features of the signals, as opposed to discovering genuinely new features. Moreover, we offer a novel method of removing a hand-engineered feature from the network's hypothesis space, thus forcing it to try and learn representations which are different from known ones, as a method of scientific exploration. We then build on existing work in the field of interpretability, specifically class activation maps, to try and infer what new features the network has learned. We demonstrate this approach using ECG and EEG signals. With respect to ECG signals we show that for the specific task of classifying atrial fibrillation, DNNs are likely rediscovering known features. We also show how our method could be used to discover new features, by selectively removing some ECG features and rediscovering them. We further examine how could our method be used as a tool for examining scientific hypotheses. We simulate this scenario by looking into the importance of eye movements in classifying sleep from EEG. We show that our tool can successfully focus a researcher's attention by bringing to light patterns in the data that would be hidden otherwise.","tags":[],"title":"Using Deep Networks for Scientific Discovery in Physiological Signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This post will summarize the main points in our recent work - Using Deep Networks for Scientific Discovery in Physiological Signals, which will be was presented at the 2020 Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference. Code for the framework and experiments can be found here.\n Motivation Despite the tremendous breakthroughs that deep learning models have brought in the last decade, they remain largely undeployed in high stakes domains like healthcare. Clinicians do not trust the outputs of complex black box models, and prefer to work with simple, interpretable systems that base their decisions on theoretically grounded and understood features.\nFor example, in the case of cardiac abnormality detection from ECG signals, practitioners are likely to trust a simple decision tree that uses features they understand like variance of the heartbeat interval series, energy content in different parts of the signal etc.; They likely won\u0026rsquo;t trust a classifier that bases its decisions on deep representations. See this very good survey on what clinicians want.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s exactly the super efficient representation extraction capabilities that make deep learning models so special. End to end models trained in hours exceed or compare to performance of systems that are based on decades-long research and engineering of useful features. In uncharted areas (for example if a new sensing modality would be invented), deep learning models would prove useful from day zero.\nWhat if we could extract interpretable, clinically sound features from the neural network\u0026rsquo;s latent representation, to be used in simple machine learning models? Then these models would be easily deployed in healthcare and other high stakes domains. This is the main motivation for our work.\n Main idea To do that, we need two things:\n A way to understand which aspect of the signal the latent representation captures and focuses on. We use class activations maps (CAMs) for this aim. A way to make the network remove a feature from the latent representation\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis space. We solve this by modifying the network\u0026rsquo;s architechture and loss function: concatenating the external feature to the latent representation layer, and imposing statistical independence between the two.  The reason we need a mechanism to unlearn a predefined feature from the network\u0026rsquo;s representation is that we imagine an iterative discovery process. At first, no domain knowledge is available, and so we can learn the task without constraints, using some visualization scheme (like CAMs) to derive a first set of useful, interpretable features. Next, we would like to extract only the residual information - what is not encoded in the first set of features. To do this we need a notion of independence, or orthogonality, between two representations. Only when the network\u0026rsquo;s representation is independent from the already known features could we hope to discover a new feature set. This process goes on and on, until no more information is extracted from the network.\n Method Achieving this goal can be broken down into 3 steps: Building the constrained representation, ensuring its validity (that it\u0026rsquo;s indeed independent, for example) and visualizing the activations to extract features.\nConstruction of the constrained representation We assume we have access to a set of $n$ samples of the form $(x_1,f_1,y_1), \u0026hellip; , (x_n,f_n,y_n)$, where: $x_i$ are raw signals, for example ECG signals; the vectors $f_i$ are hand-engineered features, calculated as a deterministic function of $x_i$, and typically of much lower dimension than $x_i$; and, $y_i \\in [1,\\ldots,k]$ are discrete labels.\nThe main goal of the architecture and loss function proposed below are to learn DNN features (denoted $g_i$) which are on the one hand informative about the labels $y_i$, but on the other hand contain as little information as possible about the hand engineered features $f_i$. This is achieved by combining two elements: a term added to the objective function which encourages statistical independence between the $f_i$ and $g_i$, and an architecture which encourages $g_i$ to be non-redundant with respect to $f_i$.\nIndependence measure\nThe measure chosen to enforce independence between the hand-engineered features $f_i$ and the DNN\u0026rsquo;s representation $g_i$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which is based on the eigenspectrum of covariance operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.\nThere are various other measures of statistical independence; the advantage of HSIC is that it is non-parametric, unlike mutual information, and so it is fit for samples not following a prescribed distributional form. In addition, it does not require training an additional model (i.e. an inference network for variational approximation or an adversarial network).\nHSIC can be thought of as a non-linear extension of the cross-covariance between two random variables. Unlike the cross-covariance, the HSIC between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ equals $0$ if and only if $X$ is independent of $Y$ (under certain regularity conditions).\n More on HSIC This HSIC loss is calculated in the following manner. For $\\mathcal{F, G}$ RKHSs with universal kernels $k$, $l$ we compute the kernel matrices $K_{ij} = k(f_i,f_j)$ and $L_{ij} = l(g_i,g_j)$. Both $k$ and $l$ were selected to be Gaussian kernels: $$ K_{i,j} = e^{\\frac{{|| f_i-f_j ||}^2_2}{\\sigma^2}} $$ With $L_{i,j}$ computed in a similar manner. Then the scaled Hilbert-Schmidt norm of their cross covariance matrix is calculated: $$ \\widehat{HSIC}(\\{(f_i,g_j\\}^n_{i=1}; \\mathcal{F, G} ) = \\frac{1}{(n-1)^2} \\cdot \\textbf{tr}(KHLH) $$ where $H_{ij}=\\delta_{i,j}-\\frac{1}{n}$ is a centering matrix.   Setting the bandwidth $\\sigma$\nFor each kernel matrix, the bandwidth $\\sigma$ is set to be the median pairwise distance of the data points, a heuristic described here. Since $f$ is a fixed representation space, its median pairwise distance can be computed once before training. However $g$ changes every training step, so its bandwidth is updated accordingly at every training step based on a moving average between the current median pairwise distance and the previously set bandwidth.\nConcatentation\nThe hand-engineered features $f$ are usually highly predictive for the selected task. In order to further encourage the DNN latent representation $g$ to be distinct from $f$, the two representations are concatenated before passing them on to the final layer of the network. This is done to prevent, as much as possible, from the network representation $g$ to try and replicate $f$, even when under the HSIC constraint. We have found that it is not possible to achieve both reasonable classification accuracy on the original task and sufficient independence from the external representation without this concatenation step.\nLoss function\nThe loss function of the network\u0026rsquo;s output is given by: $$ \\lambda \\text{HSIC}\\left([f_1,\\ldots f_n];[g_1,\\ldots,g_n]\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{CrossEntropy}\\left(\\hat{y}_i,y_i\\right), $$ where $\\lambda$ is a hyperparameter controlling the degree of independence induced between the DNN representation $g_i$ and the hand-engineered representations $f_i$. This parameter is tuned to ensure both high performance on the original task and sufficient independence relative to the external features.\nSchematic view\nIf that sounded complicated, maybe a diagram would clear things up: This concludes what we refer to as the main task.\nValidation of the representation So, we trained a neural network and validated that it yields a reasonable classification accuracy, but what guarantees do we have that (1) the network has succeeded in achieving true independence between the hand-engineered features and internal network representation while (2) retaining some information about the label within the DNN representation? We define two auxiliary tasks whose aim is to boost our confidence in the claims made in the main task\nIndependence\nThe HSIC term in our loss function is meant to induce statistical independence between the hand-engineered features $f$ and the DNN features $g$. We validate that this is indeed achieved by checking whether one can predict the features $f$ when given the features $g$ as input. We do this by training a multi-task DNN whose input is $g$ and output labels are the entries of $f$. We then measure the held-out squared correlation $R^2$, averaged across the dimensions of $f$. An average $R^2$ value close to 0 indicates a high degree of independence. As a further reference point, this value is compared to the $R^2$ value obtained using an network with the same architecture as ours but without the HSIC term (equivalent to setting $\\lambda$ = 0), which we call the baseline model\nResidual Information\nTo confirm that the obtained representation $g$ holds useful information for the task in question, we run the following evaluation: Our method is trained on a sample set $train_1$ . Then we apply the representation function $g$ to a separate sample set $train_2$. We fit a vanilla 3-layer network, which we call Rep2Label, predicting $y$ from $g$ on the training set $train_2$. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of Rep2Label on a held-out test set. An accuracy greater then chance indicates that the latent representation still holds valuable information about the label and can be analyzed for our goal of scientific discovery.\nFeature discovery through visualization The third and final step in the proposed framework is to visualize the network\u0026rsquo;s activations over different aspects of the input signals using CAMs. CAMs are a technique for visualizing spatially localized class-relevant information. They are obtained by a simple matrix multiplication between a CNN’s activations (before global average pooling) and the weights of the fully connected layer.\nFor a physiological signal the output of CAM is, for each sample, a time series showing what parts of the signal produce strong activations per a given class. We (1) align these activation profiles around a meaningful physiological landmark, e.g. an R-peak in ECG signals or a rapid eye movement in EEG signals, (2) normalize the activation profiles to [0, 1], and (3) average them over the entire test set. When the mere existence of an event is significant, we would expect CAM peak over the event start. This high activation over the event’s start is interpreted as importance for the task.\n Some results This approach is demonstrated for two types of signals and tasks: Atrial fibrillation detection in ECG signals and REM detection in EEG signals. Both these tasks were very well studied in the medical literature over the last decades, so we do not aim to discover anything new here. Instead, we aim to discover the already known domain knowledge. Because discovery is a qualitative notion and we do not have any quantitative measures of success, it was important to select example tasks that could serve as benchmarks for our approach.\nThe full results are in the paper, including details about the experimental setup. Here I will focus on one type of result from the ECG use case. Data and task\nThe dataset used for this experiment is from the 2017 PhysioNet Challenge.\nThe original challenge\u0026rsquo;s task was to classify single-lead ECGs to the following categories: Normal, atrial fibrillation (AF), other and noisy. We modified the task to be a binary classification: detection of AF.\nExternal features\nWhen clinicians diagnose AF from ECGs, they focus on 2 types of signal properties:\n Properties of the RR interval sequence. In cases of AF, the heartbeats are irregularly spaced. Hand-engineered features that capture this behavior include median, STD, RMS, multiscale entropy, minimum and maximum of the RR sequence. Properties of the P-waves. P-waves are the first positive deflection in a normal heartbeat. In AF, the P-wave may not exist at each beat. Hand-engineered features that characterize this part of the signal include the maximum, STD and energy of the amplitude of the time windows where the P-Wave should appear.  The model was trained 4 times: With no features (baseline), with the RR features, with the P-wave features and with all features together. After ensuring that the models have passed the validation tests, the following mean activations were extracted.\nRR constrained model: P-wave constrained model: For the RR model (whose representation is encouraged not to use R-peak related information), we observe an almost smooth activation with a clear peak which starts around 300ms before the R-peak and ends around 100ms before the R-peak. That is, The RR model’s activation peak has an almost perfect overlap with the expected location of the P-wave window. In addition, in the P-Wave model’s activation (i.e a model that is pushed to not use P-wave-based features), it seems that the activation shifted toward the R-peak starting point. As one of the hallmark features of AF is the loss of regularity of the intervals between consecutive R-peaks, an increase in activation at the expected location of the R-peak seems to reflect the shift of the internal representation.\n Discussion This work shows a proof of concept for the discovery of interpretable features by imposing constraints on neural representations. There are some limitations, including:\n The proposed framework is relevant mostly to local, morphological features due to the nature of the class activation maps. The real challenge of feature discovery is not nearly solved by this approach. A domain expert needs to translate the activation templates and come up with interpretable functions or scientific understanding that capture the exposed pattern.

For practitioners coming from domains like healthcare, advertisement or collaborative filtering, these questions do not seem to fit in their everyday way of thinking. The reason is that for these questions, we are interested in the effect of an intervention for a single unit, while we do not have any data about this intervention for other units.\nTake the German reunification as an example - it is only Germany that was reunified, and the task is to infer the causal effect of that historic event. As for the other examples - sure, California was not the first to implement an anti-smoking program, and Uber is active in many cities over the globe apart from Paris. But the task considered here is to use only the intervention data for the unit in question.\n The qualitative approach It seems insensible to make inferences on a single unit - what credibility could we attain? What would be the statistical properties of the estimator?\nBut for decades, qualitative analyses that seem unsensible were carried out by economists and social scientists. They would meticulously find relevant controls for the relevant treated unit, relying on informal statements of affinity between the units. Then, with a chosen control unit, identification schemes like difference-in-differences would be applied.\nThis approach has some merit - the resulting estimator is interpretable, transparent and simple. It is easy to communicate it and argue about the choice of control units. Yet it\u0026rsquo;s clear that it is not the optimal approach, at least for practitioners of the quantitative / statistical learning schools. So the question is - can we do better? Can we devise a data-driven approach for causal effect estimation of aggregate interventions? Can we phrase a clear objective for the estimator?\n Synthetic Controls Introduced in 2003 and formalized in 2010 by Alberto Abadie and colleagues, the synthetic control aims to bridge between the traditional qualitative approaches of the social sciences and the modern data driven approaches. It strikes a balance between the two by offering a clear objective function to optimize while constraining the model to remain transparent, interpretable and simple. It is applicable to almost any domain, and became very popular thanks to its lenient assumptions. Esteemed economists Susan Athey and Guido Imbens have called it \u0026ldquo;arguably the most important innovation in the policy evaluation literature in the last 15 years\u0026rdquo;. Sounds interesting? Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in.\n The main idea The qualitative approach calls for a manual selection of control units from a pool of potential control units. The main idea of the synthetic control method is to forgo any kind of manual control selection. Instead, the method makes use of all the control units in a data-driven approach. The controls are weighted based on their similarity to the treated unit, yielding the synthetic control as a weighed combination of the original units.\n Potential outcomes - click here for details We can formalize the main idea above in the language of potential outcomes:  For the control units, we observe the potential outcome under no-intervention For the treated unit, we observe its potential outcome under no-intervention in the pre-intervention period, and its potential outcome under the intervention in the post-intervention period To calculate the causal effect, we need the treated unit\u0026rsquo;s potential outcome under no-intervention in the post-intervention period The synthetic control emulates this potential outcome. It attempts to answer the question of \u0026ldquo;What would have been the outcome for the treated unit, without the intervention?\u0026rdquo;   We see that the task of causal effect estimation boils down to finding the optimal weighting of the control units. And how shall one find the optimal weights? This is the point where the road forks - there are many suggestions for phrasing of the optimization problem, each with its own pros and cons. The next section will describe one possibility, which is the originally proposed apparoch by Abadie et al; A discussion of its limitations in face of more contemporary approaches will follow. But first - some (minimal) notation.\n The setting  We have data for $T$ time periods, $T_0$ of them are pre-intervention and $T_1$ belong to the post-intervention period We have $J$ control units, $j\\in{1,..,n}$, and one treated unit ($j=0$) The measured outcomes for each unit and time period is $Y_{jt} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times J+1}$ The synthetic control is defined as $\\sum_{j=1}^{J} Y_{jt} \\cdot W_j$ The causal effect estimate is thus $\\tau_t = Y_{0t} - \\sum_{j=1}^{J} Y_{jt} \\cdot W_j$ In addition, for some methods we require a set of $K$ outcome predictors for each unit: $X_{kj}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{K \\times J+1}$. These may be lagged outcomes (pre-intervention) or other auxiliary features (or both)   ADH\u0026rsquo;s synthetic control Proposed by Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (hence the name) in this paper, this is the seminal proposal for policy evaluation using synthetic controls. Apart from introducing the main idea above, they present the following objective function:\n$$W^* \\in argmin_{W \\in {\\Delta}^{J}} \\lVert \\mathbf{X_0-X_{\\neg0} \\cdot W} \\rVert $$\nSome remarks:\n  The similarity between the controls and the treated units is measured with respect to the features $X$, while the synthetic control is constructed using the outcomes $Y$. It might seem more sensible to perform the matching with respect the outcome from the start. After all, we are interested in a good pre-treatment fit for the outcome, and the best fit would be obtained using the outcome and not a proxy for it. Indeed, recent works claim that \u0026ldquo;covariates are of less relevance in applications; outcomes tend to be substantially more important than covariates in terms of predictive power\u0026rdquo; ( see here)\n  The weights are constrained to lie in the J-simplex, i.e. they should be non-negative and sum to one. The authors impose this constraint to avoid extrapolation and increase the method\u0026rsquo;s transparency. But like the previous point, here too recent studies recommend to remove this constraint, stating that it is not obvious that restricting the weights this way is optimal ( see here). From a different angle, this constraint could be seen as weight regularization, for example this work shows an equivalence between the simplex constraint and LASSO regularization with a fixed coefficient. The question that arises is - why use a fixed-strength regularization, instead of using LASSO with cross-validation?\n  These are valid and thoughtful concerns. I think it would be best to take the main idea of the synthetic control method, but to experiment with the implementation details for each use case.\n An example use case Estimating the effect of California’s tobacco control program This section will demonstrate the described method on a specific use case. The case of California\u0026rsquo;s tobacco control program was one of the first applications of the synthetic control method, and it was introduced in this paper. I will recover all steps: data processing, feature extraction, synthetic control construction and causal effect estimation - exactly as shown in the paper and described above (no modifications at all to the original method). If something wasn\u0026rsquo;t clear above - hopefully this example will clarify things up.\nThe research question In 1988 California implemented a large scale tobacco control program, called proposition 99, that increased California’s cigarette excise tax by 25 cents per pack, earmarked the tax revenues to health and anti-smoking education budgets, funded anti-smoking media campaigns, and spurred local clean indoor-air ordinances throughout the state. The question we are interested here it to evaluate the policy\u0026rsquo;s effect in terms of per-capita cigarette consumption. The potential controls in this case are all US states (that\u0026rsquo;s an RAS).\nData  The main outcome is annual per-capita cigarette consumption. The data for this can be found here. In addition to the main outcome, we will utilize some features that correlate with it (GDP, ages, beer consumption etc).

Nice and tidy.\nSome notes about the data\n Measurements are recorded at 5-minute intervals. That\u0026rsquo;s a very high resolution, much more than needed to answer the research question. But it\u0026rsquo;ll be very helpful - it will allow for aggressive smoothing of the noisy measurements. In total, we have almost 1 million measurements of each pollutant. From the slice above we can suspect that the measurement resolution for CO (Carbon Monoxide) might be small compared to its distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to check:  df_aqm['CO'].value_counts(normalize=True).head(7)  0.3 0.338305 0.2 0.186482 0.4 0.182812 0.5 0.073091 0.1 0.051982 0.6 0.039140 0.0 0.035468 Name: CO, dtype: float64  And indeed more than 70% of the CO measurements fall in one of 3 distinct values. This implies that the CO measurement is not accurate enough in capturing this pollutant\u0026rsquo;s distribution. We should keep that in mind when drawing inferences based on CO.\nMoving on to a general overview of the data, let\u0026rsquo;s use the convenient \u0026lsquo;describe\u0026rsquo; method:\ndf_aqm.describe()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO     count 237295.000000 602180.000000 800202.000000 97432.000000 844796.000000 827176.000000 826981.000000 826945.000000   mean 1.718825 0.242009 19.774215 49.704957 0.366657 20.821325 42.579953 21.816400   std 2.763984 0.300786 17.774355 49.961126 0.249257 16.310098 58.644492 46.070798   min -0.800000 -0.010000 -29.500000 -10.100000 -0.400000 -4.800000 -4.600000 -5.000000   25% 0.100000 0.060000 10.800000 24.000000 0.200000 7.700000 8.500000 0.300000   50% 0.800000 0.150000 17.200000 37.500000 0.300000 15.400000 19.300000 3.300000   75% 2.400000 0.320000 25.400000 59.400000 0.400000 31.900000 51.300000 18.400000   max 136.200000 12.700000 562.000000 810.900000 23.400000 262.400000 865.500000 763.800000     We can immediately notice negative measurements for all pollutants. This is not a good sign, because while this can be easily addressed and fixed, it increases our suspicion of more serious problems in the dataset that would be difficult to identify.\nBut that will be addressed later. Now we have to solve the issue of negative measurements. Let\u0026rsquo;s first understand the extent of the problem:\npercent_negative = 100*(df_aqm[pollutants] \u0026lt; 0).mean(axis=0).values print(f'{pollutants[percent_negative.argmax()]} has {percent_negative.max():.1f}% negative values')  NO has 8.8% negative values  That\u0026rsquo;s quite bad. Two of the simplest ways to fix this issue are:\n Clip the negative values to 0 Replace them with NaNs  However, these two approaches may or may not be the best thing to do, depending on:\n The mechanism that has caused this issue The quality of data required to answer the research question  Since I don\u0026rsquo;t have a substantiated answer to any of these questions, I tried to find out what domain practitioners recommend on doing. Here is a thread with some opinions and insights on the matter. The authors propose to differentiate between two situations, and act accordingly:\n If the datapoints exhibit sudden short drops below 0, this probably indicates an instrument malfunction. In this case, it is advised to replace the invalid value with an average of some neighborhood. If consecutive values below 0 are recorded for long times compared to the instrument\u0026rsquo;s integration time, this is probably rooted in the true air conditions. In this case, negative values imply that the real value was below the instrument\u0026rsquo;s detection limit. The suggested approach would be to replace the negative values with the known detection limit, or 0 if it isn\u0026rsquo;t known (like in our case). More justifications for this approach can be found in Polissar et al, 1998  If we want to follow these guidelines, we need to decide for each negative measurement if it the former case or the latter. This will be coded at a later stage.\nChecking for systematic data collection flaws It is important to make sure that our dataset does not have any systematic flaws in the data collection process. For example, later we would like to demonstrate the fluctuations of pollutants as function of the weekday. In this case, if some days are recorded significantly less often than other days, any conclusion we would like to state as for the weekday trend might be invalidated.\nAn easy way to check this is to print the value counts of the weekdays:\ndf_aqm['Weekday Name'] = df_aqm.index.day_name() df_aqm['Weekday Name'].value_counts()  Sunday 126420 Saturday 126145 Friday 126144 Monday 126144 Wednesday 126144 Thursday 126144 Tuesday 126144 Name: Weekday Name, dtype: int64  We see that the dataset is pretty much balanced in terms of weekday logging, and that is reassuring. However, it could also be that the logging system simply adds an entry for every 5-minute interval, while the measurement instruments malfunction with some systematic (i.e not at random) pattern. A complete examination would be:\ndf_aqm[pollutants].isna().groupby(df_aqm['Weekday Name']).mean()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO   Weekday Name             Friday 0.731030 0.271008 0.100235 0.892718 0.040160 0.061295 0.061430 0.061430   Monday 0.731204 0.394097 0.094646 0.887097 0.046114 0.067835 0.068121 0.068398   Saturday 0.730992 0.344128 0.100820 0.894621 0.043846 0.064632 0.064767 0.064767   Sunday 0.734813 0.313724 0.100791 0.884710 0.046757 0.060141 0.060354 0.060354   Thursday 0.728350 0.297026 0.093805 0.892662 0.043442 0.062254 0.062571 0.062579   Tuesday 0.733376 0.305429 0.084047 0.886312 0.043363 0.069159 0.069413 0.069413   Wednesday 0.729674 0.302345 0.084071 0.889745 0.041334 0.059353 0.059559 0.059559     We see that the fraction of missing data changes significantly from one pollutant to another. In addition, for each pollutant, the fraction of missing values changes per weekday, but for now it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say if these differences are consequential. Meanwhile, it\u0026rsquo;s good to keep this table in mind, and we might return to it depending on the analysis and inference that we would like to conduct.\nSo we can conclude this step with the reassurance that the data does not exhibit major systematic data collection flaws, and we can move on in to the analysis. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the data in its most raw form - just a scatterplot of every datapoint:\naxes=df_aqm[pollutants].plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2');  We can notice a few things from this plot:\n PM10 and SO2 are not continuously monitored along the 8 year period. Plots and analyses in the following will not ignore them, as we can still draw some conclusions using these limited measurements We can see the first hint of a seasonal trend: it seems like NOx and NO follow an annual trend. Because of the scatterplot\u0026rsquo;s density it could also be that only a few outliers paint a picture that looks like an annual trend, while in reality they do not contribute a significant amount to the total trend. Therefore a more detailed analysis is required to validate this claim It seems like NO2 and NOx are identical (or almost identical measurements). Reading about NOx it seems rather amusing, as NOx is defined as the sum the nitrogen oxides NO and NO2. But it is the visualization that is misleading, and a closer look reveals that NOx is always higher than NO2.  Let\u0026rsquo;s see if on average there is a real annual trend for some substances:\nlog_interval = 5 # minutes samples_per_week = int(60 / log_interval * 24 * 7) window = samples_per_week*4 overlap = int(2*samples_per_week) df_aqm.rolling( window=window, center=False, min_periods=samples_per_week).mean()[samples_per_week*2::overlap].plot( marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2');  This plot shows rolling averages of the measurements, with windows of 4 weeks and an overlap of 2 weeks. A similar result could be obtained using a simple groupby with a monthly frequency:\ndf_aqm.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='M')).mean()\nBut the overlapping windows add a degree of smoothing which is (arguably) preferable in this case.\nIf you are disappointed too with pandas' lack of an overlap parameter in the rolling function, you can contribute to the discussion here.\nAnyway, enough with the ranting. The above plot shows that all nitrogen oxide measurements (and also benzene to a lesser extent) follow a clear annual trend peaking at winter. It is still not clear what\u0026rsquo;s the cause of this modulation, and we will revisit it later in the analysis.\nThe same trends could be demonstrated using a different visualization, plotting the 8 year daily averages of every pollutants.\ndf_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.dayofyear).mean().plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2'); plt.xlabel('Day of the Year');  The annual trend of NO, NO2, NOx and benzene is validated through this plot. In addition, we can notice a peculiar drop in CO values around day 240. A closer look reveals that this drop is at day 243. This day is August 31st, the last day of summer vacation for 1.5 million kids. Coincidence? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What do you think?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move now to a weekly analysis:\nax = sns.boxplot(data=df_aqm, x='Weekday Name', y='NOX', order=['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'], palette=sns.cubehelix_palette(7, start=.5, rot=-.75, dark=0.3, reverse=True)).set_ylim([0,70]);  For NOx, there is a clear weekly trend in the amount of air pollution measured. Note that the outliers have been cropped out of the plot. For other pollutants, the trend is not as impressive:\nax = sns.boxplot(data=df_aqm, x='Weekday Name', y='CO', order=['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'], palette=sns.cubehelix_palette(7, start=.5, rot=-.75, dark=0.3, reverse=True)).set_ylim([0,1]);  And we also see the discrete nature of the CO measurements, as noted earlier. Another way to look at the weekly flactations would be to plot the raw measurements for a specific period of time:\ndf_sub = df_aqm.loc['2019-07':'2019-09'] fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,5)) ax.plot(df_sub.groupby(df_sub.index.date).median()['NOX'], marker='o', linestyle='-') ax.set_ylabel('NOx [ppb]') ax.set_title('') ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.WeekdayLocator(byweekday=mdates.SATURDAY)) ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%b %d'));  For this 3-month period, the lowest measured values were always on Saturdays, agreeing with the boxplot above.\nThe third and last seasonal trend to be analyzed is the dependence on the hour of the day.\ndf_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.time).mean().plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2'); plt.xticks([\u0026quot;08:00\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;12:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;16:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;20:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;00:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;04:00\u0026quot;]);  Some notes about this plot:\n Most pollutants peak in the morning. Some right at the rush hour (NO, NO2, NOX, Benzene) and some a bit later (SO2, PM10) It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like PM2.5 adheres to any logical pattern. CO peaks around midnight. It seems as it has a slow buildup process, followed by a slow decreasing phase. If nitrogen oxides are caused mainly by transportation, then the rush hour attribution above could make sense. In this case, we could also attribute the slow increase and plateau in the afternoon/evening to the fact (or assumption?) that commute back home is spread on longer hours, compared to the narrow rush hour. I\u0026rsquo;m no expert on the sources of each pollutant, be it transportation, industry, the port or natural factors. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know if any of these hypotheses make any sort of sense.  Air pollution and temperatures The above trends show a clear correlation between the season/month and the average measured pollutants (at least for nitrogen oxides and benzene). But what is the cause of this modulation - is it the time itself? Or maybe it is the temperature? There could be many potential causes, and estimating each of these effects is a difficult problem, according to the identification strategies of causal inference. Instead, we can choose to stay in the realm of mere correlations, and while they do not imply causation, we could speculate what is a reasonable claim and what is not.\nA simple examination would be to evaluate how much of this modulation is governed by the change in temperature (disregarding the day of the year). To this end, I downloaded a second dataset, this time from Israeli Meteorological Service. It includes daily measurements (low and high temperatures) from the meteorological station closest to the air quality monitoring station, situated at BAZAN Group\u0026rsquo;s plant in Haifa.\nA straightforward cleaning yields a dataset that looks like this:\ndf_temp = pd.read_csv('Data/ims_data.csv', sep=\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, encoding=\u0026quot;ISO-8859-8\u0026quot;) # translate df from Hebrew df_temp = df_temp.rename(columns={'משתנה': 'variable', 'תאריך': 'DateTime', 'חיפה בתי זיקוק (600)': 'value'}) df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מינימום(C°)', 'variable'] = 'min temp' df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מקסימום(C°)', 'variable'] = 'max temp' df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מינימום ליד הקרקע(C°)', 'variable'] = 'ground temp' # Delete the record 'ground temp' (first make sure it's empty) assert(df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'ground temp','value'].values == '-').all() df_temp = df_temp.drop(df_temp[df_temp['variable'] == 'ground temp'].index) # Convert to datetime df_temp['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_temp['DateTime'],infer_datetime_format=True) df_temp['value'] = df_temp['value'].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce') df_temp.tail()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  variable DateTime value     8638 min temp 2020-04-27 11.6   8640 max temp 2020-04-28 23.2   8641 min temp 2020-04-28 11.0   8643 max temp 2020-04-29 22.9   8644 min temp 2020-04-29 17.1     Let\u0026rsquo;s plot a histogram of the daily lows and highs, just to see that the dataset makes sense (it does):\ng = sns.FacetGrid(df_temp, hue='variable', height=6) g.map(sns.distplot, 'value', bins=30, hist=True, kde=False, hist_kws={\u0026quot;linewidth\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;alpha\u0026quot;: 0.7}) g.add_legend(title=' ') g.axes[0,0].set_title(\u0026quot;Distribution of minimal and maximal temperatures\u0026quot;) g.axes[0,0].set_xlabel('Temperature [Celsius]');  To merge (fuse?) the datasets, we need to calculate an aggregate value for the pollutants for each day (because temperatures are measured only once a day). Averaging the measurements of each day is the simplest thing to do.\ndf_pol_day = df_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.date).mean() df_pol_day.index = pd.to_datetime(df_pol_day.index) df_max = df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'max temp', ['DateTime', 'value']] df_max.rename(columns={'value': 'max temp'}, inplace=True) df_max.set_index('DateTime', inplace=True, drop=True) df_min = df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'min temp', ['DateTime', 'value']] df_min.rename(columns={'value': 'min temp'}, inplace=True) df_min.set_index('DateTime', inplace=True, drop=True) df_pol_temp = df_pol_day.merge(right=df_max, how='inner', left_index=True, right_index=True) df_pol_temp = df_pol_temp.merge(right=df_min, how='inner', left_index=True, right_index=True) df_pol_temp.tail()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO max temp min temp     2020-04-25 0.031802 0.049213 10.824653 NaN 0.279152 1.761702 1.509220 0.010284 22.3 17.1   2020-04-26 0.089753 0.036250 9.450694 NaN 0.295406 6.074823 7.617376 1.686170 23.0 16.1   2020-04-27 0.217314 0.079306 12.359028 NaN 0.310247 18.504255 28.706383 10.386525 23.0 11.6   2020-04-28 0.595760 0.091632 13.841319 NaN 0.332155 17.207801 26.422340 9.412057 23.2 11.0   2020-04-29 0.102827 0.020035 10.708333 NaN 0.260777 1.787943 1.271986 0.000000 22.9 17.1     sns.jointplot(x='min temp', y='NOX', data=df_pol_temp, kind=\u0026quot;reg\u0026quot;, stat_func=corr_coef); warnings.filterwarnings(action='default')  With a significant correlation of -0.58, the measured NOx values can be explained to some degree by the temperatures. It would be interesting to see if other meteorological factors, like humidity and wind, can explain even more of the NOx fluctuations.\nClosing remarks This notebook described a preliminary exploration of the air quality monitoring data in Haifa. It is by no means an exhaustive analysis, it is just a set of steps used to increase the understanding of the dataset. If you have any comment - an analysis that you think should be done, a peculiar result that should be examined or anything else - I would love to know!\nThis is not a conclusion, as it is only the start of the analysis. In the next chapter, I will evaluate the causal effect of Haifa\u0026rsquo;s new low emission zone using the synthetic control method.

It turns out that open polls, where voters can see previous votes and their votes are visible to others, have different voting profiles compared to hidden polls. In a recent paper, Zou et al. (2015) show that voters act stratigically in open polls, and this change in behaviour includes:\n Open polls have higher response rates for very popular time slots Open polls have higher response rates for very unpopular time slots The average reported availability is higher in open polls compared to hidden polls  The first point not surprising - responders vote more for the popular time slots either because these alternatives are simply better for most voters, or because they feel the need to be cooperative with the group\u0026rsquo;s choices. The second point however does not make sense at first - why would a repsonder vote for a time slot that is clearly not going to be selected? The authors suggest that this is because voters in open polls have an incentive to appear more cooperative:\n \u0026ldquo;There is an implicit social expectation that every responder will mark as many slots as possible. Therefore a responder in open polls may be motivated to mark more slots. In other words, bearing in mind that other participants can see her name and vote, a participant may want to approve more time slots to appear more cooperative even if they are less convenient for herself.\u0026rdquo;\n The third point is likely a consequence of the first two points.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a typical Doodle poll. It is also available here.\n  What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with that? One might think there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong that voters in open polls behave differently than in hidden polls. But actually this can have a substantial negative impact on the quality of the selected time: Alrawi et al. (2016) argue via a theoretical welfare analysis that when voters are being more generous with their time, this can lead to inferior time slots being selected.\nWhat can be done? While we can\u0026rsquo;t change human nature, we can come up with suggestions for models and algorithms that would cancel out the social bias. Since hidden polls have a higher chance of maximizing social utility, these algorithms should approximate what voting profile would have been recorded if the poll had been hidden. In this short project, a collaboration with Bar Eini-Porat, we propose a simple solution to this problem. This notebook desribes the data and simulation we rely on, details the design considerations we faced, and shows the results of our suggested approach.\nOutline The rest of this notebook is organized as follows. First the dataset of Doodle polls is presented. Then the process of simulating synthetic open polls from real hidden polls is described, followed by detail about the debiasing model. The notebook concludes with results and a discussion on limitations and future directions.\nDataset The data used for this project is a small slice of the dataset that was introduced in Reinecke et al. (2013). The original dataset, provided by Doodle, consisted of 1,771,430 anonymized date/time polls that were selected at random from a time period in mid-2011. Like Zou et al. (2015), we focus our analysis on polls with at least three participants, at least four time slots and only yes/no options. Unlike Zou et al. (2015), we analyze Doodle polls from all around the world, and use only hidden polls for our analysis. The obtained dataset consists of 104 polls and has a median of 9 responders and 10 time slots.\nSimulating open polls from hidden polls The foundamental problem of causal inference is what makes the problem of evaluating a proposed solution so difficult. Meaning we never have access to the two parallel worlds of both an open poll and a hidden poll describing the same scheduling problem with the same group of people. Following Alrawi et al. (2016), we treat the hidden polls of the dataset as ground truth: In a hidden poll each participant casts a vote based solely on their true availability, without introducing social considerations. This is the reason we chose to use only the hidden polls of the dataset.\nFrom each hidden poll we simulate an open poll using the following approach. We keep the number of participants and the number of time slots unchanged. The first voter (usually the poll initiator) is not affected by social considerations, so her approved time slots are unaltered in the simulated open poll compared to the original hidden poll. As for the next responders, their approved time slots may change according to the poll\u0026rsquo;s history up until their vote.\nIn more detail, the simulation process consists of a three-step mechanism:\n  Generate individual utilities\nAn individual utility $u_{ij}$ with $0 \\leq u_{ij} \\leq 1$ is assinged to each voter $v_i$ for each time slot $a_j$ indicating her valuation of attending the meeting or event during that time slot. These utilities are called \u0026lsquo;individual\u0026rsquo; as they are not affected by other voters. We assume that there is a global, fixed \u0026lsquo;yes-threshold\u0026rsquo; $\\tau_1$ that represents the utility beyond which a voter “typically” votes yes, so each voter $v_i$ is expected to say yes to a time slot $a_j$ when her utility for that slot satisfies $u_{ij} \\geq \\tau_1$. Then, in order to comply with the hidden poll, we generate individual utilities greater then $\\tau_1$ for the approved votes in the original hidden poll, and smaller then $\\tau_1$ for the disapproved votes:\n  $$u^{ind}(a) \\sim U[\\tau_1,1] \\text{ for } a \\in A_1$$\n$$u^{ind}(a) \\sim U[0,\\tau_1] \\text{ for } a \\notin A_1$$\nWhere $A_1$ is the set of approved time slots for a voter in the original hidden poll.\n Generate social utilities\nLike in the case of the individual utilities, social utilities are generated for each voter and time slot in each poll. The social utilities reflect the behavioral difference between hidden and open polls, i.e. they will be a function of the popularity of the time slot. Time slot popularity is defined as the ratio between approved votes to total number of votes.\nIn addition, although it was not discussed in Zou et al. (2015), we believe that the social utilities should also depend on the relative poll position, i.e. the fraction of the current voter to the total number of poll participants. For example, the second voter is less affected by social bias compared to the 10th voter. Since we do not have an accurate measure of the magnitude of the strategic behavior described in Zou et al. (2015), we set this magnitude so that it will comply with the increase in average availability in open polls compared to hidden polls (from 0.53 to 0.39, see section 2.3 of Zou et al. (2015)).\nApart from the magnitude of the social effect, we also need to set a functional form for it. We propose a sigmoidal-shaped curve for the social utility as function of popularity. This is an asymmetrical gain-gain function that outputs an unpopularity-gain for values below some neutral popularity and a popularity gain for values above it. Similarly, we propose a sigmoidal-shaped curve for the social utility as function of relative position.\nThe next figure illustrates these functions. The dashed vertical line denotes the neutral popularity, it need not be set at 0.5.\n    The social utility as function of both popularity and relative position is the product of the above two functions, scaled down by a factor representing the maximal possible social utility.\nGenerate approved time slots  Finally, an open poll is deterministically simulated from the hidden poll and generated utilities in accordance with the social voting model of Zou et al. (2015):\n$$\\text{Approve } { A_1^n,A_2^n \\cap Popular, A_2^n \\cap Unpopular }$$\nAccording to this model, there are three preference levels. A voter approves all of her most preferred slots, irrespective of their popularity. In addition, among the slots at her second preference level, the voter approves those slots that are either very popular or very unpopular. No slot of the third preference level is approved. $\\tau_1$ is the decision boundry between $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $\\tau_2$ is the decision boundry between $A_2$ and $A_3$.\nTherefore, approved votes in the synthetic open poll will be those exceeding the individual threshold (those approved in the original hidden poll), or those that, together with the social utilities, exceed the threshold: \\begin{align*} a: u^{ind}(a) \u0026gt; {\\tau_1} ; \\cup ; a: u^{ind}(a)+u^{soc}(a) \u0026gt; {\\tau_{1}} \\end{align*}\nAn important note is that the magnitude of the social effect should not exceed the difference between the thresholds of the preference groups: \\begin{align*} \\text{Maximal Social Utility} \\leq \\tau_1+\\tau_2 \\end{align*} This assures that time slots in the least preferred level ($A_3$) will not be approved, regardless of the social effect.\nDebiasing the open polls Now that we have simulated open polls, we can propose a method for circumventing the social effect. Our debiasing strategy is also a three-step process. First, we attempt to recover the social utilities that were in play for each voter and time slot. Then, we use these social utilities to weight the approved votes, with weight representing vote genuinity (a genuine vote is one that would have been approved irrespective of social considerations). Finally, we aggregate the weights to declare a winning time slot.\nIn more detail:\n  Estimate social utilities\nIn this step the social utility as function of popularity and relative position is estimated. We assume that both the functional form and social effect magnitude are known to us. This is a realistic scenario, as these quantities can be estimated efficiently from a large dataset. Computationally, this is equivalent to the first step of the simulation process. However, in the simulation process the utilities are calculated based on the ground-truth hidden poll, and here the social utilities are estimated based on the open poll history, which is itself biased from the ground-truth.\n  Calculate weights\nIn this step, we weight the voters according to the probability that their votes are genuine. Our weighting mechanism is tightly related to the estimated social utilities. It is defined as follows, where $\\hat{S_{ij}}$ are the estimated social utilities, $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter and $W_{ij}$ are the weights: $$ W_{ij} = 1-\\alpha \\cdot \\hat{S_{ij}} \\text{ for } \\alpha \u0026lt; 1 $$\n  Declare winning time slot\nThe final step is to declare a winning time slot, aggregating information from the calculated weights. We want to minimize the risk that we falsely disapprove a vote that was actually approved in the hidden poll. We can fallback to the Doodle default algorithm (labelled DDA) and choose the most popular time slot whenever we are not confident with our approach.\nWe define the DDA score to be number of votes for each time slot. We define the debiased score to be the sum of weights for each time slot. The DDA winner and debiased winner are the maximal scoring time slot in each scoring regime.\nWe choose to output a winner according to the reweighting mechanism only in cases with relatively high confidence: We recommend the highest scoring alternative in our model only in cases witg substantial score difference. Our final winning candidate for the open poll is defined as:\n$\\text{if DDA score - debiased score} \\geq \\beta \\cdot \\text{debiased score:} $\n$\\text{ final winner} = \\text{DDA winner}$\n$\\text{else final winner} = \\text{debiased winner}$\n  Results The proposed method\u0026rsquo;s performance is evaluated in the following manner. For each poll, there are four possible scenarios:\n The winner in the original hidden poll matches both the winner proposed by DDA and the winner proposed by our method in the simulated open poll and. The winner in the original hidden poll does not match neither the winner proposed by DDA nor the winner proposed by our method in the simulated open poll and. The winner in the original hidden poll matches the winner proposed by DDA, but does not match the winner proposed by our method. The winner in the original hidden poll does not match the winner proposed by DDA, but matches the winner proposed by our method.  We count the number of polls in each of the above cases. We define the method\u0026rsquo;s benefit as the difference between the number of polls in case 4 and the number of polls in case 3. A positive benefit means that our method yields more good than harm.\nFollowing is a summary of obtained benefits as function of the number of voters and the number of time slots. It is apparent that the proposed method yields positive outcomes only in cases with a relatively high number of voters and time slots.\n  If the method is restricted to these cases only, we obtain the following statistics:\n  Which means that it is possible to devise a new voting rule that has a strictly positive benefit. Discussion, limitations and future work This notebook demonstrated a simple proof of concept to circumvent some of the adverse effects of the social voting phenomenon. Of course, further discussion about the work\u0026rsquo;s limitations is warranted.\nFirst, these results have limited statistical validity, as they are constrained by the small dataset available to us. Even though each hidden poll was used to construct many open polls, the effective sample size is still limited to the number of original hidden polls. To alleviate this obstacle, we have also implemented a completely synthetic simulation that does not require real hidden polls. But since these simulated hidden polls are of questionable quality compared to the real world distribution, we found it hard to draw inferences based on them instead of the real data.\nSecond, the whole simulation and analysis environment lacks in external validity. The predictive ability of retrospective analyses is inherently problematic, and to make valid inferences, a true randomized controlled experiment would be required.\nTo conclude, while further investigation is recommended, this work demonstrated the potential for a simple voting rule to increase overall social welfare.\nReferences Alrawi, D., Anthony, B.
