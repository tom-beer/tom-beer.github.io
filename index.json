It\u0026rsquo;s always beneficial to have a thorough look at the data before starting to model it. I think it\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that any investment of time in exploratory data analysis will be returned at a later stage in terms of better modelling insights, less bugs and valid conclusions.\nDisclaimer: I have no expertise in air quality analysis, in fact this is the first time I look at data collected from an air pollution monitoring system.\nThis post was generated from a Jupyter notebook, which can be downloaded from here. The notebook goes through the following steps:\n Dataset cleaning and tidying Handling of missing values Analyzing trends of time series (daily, weekly, annual etc) Finding correlations between pairs of variables Data fusion with meteorological dataset  At a later stage, these sections will be added:\n Simple air pollution modelling Validation of the inference conducted for the ministry regarding the effect of Haifa\u0026rsquo;s LEZ.

Nice and tidy.\nSome notes about the data\n Measurements are recorded at 5-minute intervals. That\u0026rsquo;s a very high resolution, much more than needed to answer the research question. But it\u0026rsquo;ll be very helpful - it will allow for aggressive smoothing of the noisy measurements. In total, we have almost 1 million measurements of each pollutant. From the slice above we can suspect that the measurement resolution for CO (Carbon Monoxide) might be small compared to its distribution. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to check:  df_aqm['CO'].value_counts(normalize=True).head(7)  0.3 0.338305 0.2 0.186482 0.4 0.182812 0.5 0.073091 0.1 0.051982 0.6 0.039140 0.0 0.035468 Name: CO, dtype: float64  And indeed more than 70% of the CO measurements fall in one of 3 distinct values. This implies that the CO measurement is not accurate enough in capturing this pollutant\u0026rsquo;s distribution. We should keep that in mind when drawing inferences based on CO.\nMoving on to a general overview of the data, let\u0026rsquo;s use the convenient \u0026lsquo;describe\u0026rsquo; method:\ndf_aqm.describe()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO     count 237295.000000 602180.000000 800202.000000 97432.000000 844796.000000 827176.000000 826981.000000 826945.000000   mean 1.718825 0.242009 19.774215 49.704957 0.366657 20.821325 42.579953 21.816400   std 2.763984 0.300786 17.774355 49.961126 0.249257 16.310098 58.644492 46.070798   min -0.800000 -0.010000 -29.500000 -10.100000 -0.400000 -4.800000 -4.600000 -5.000000   25% 0.100000 0.060000 10.800000 24.000000 0.200000 7.700000 8.500000 0.300000   50% 0.800000 0.150000 17.200000 37.500000 0.300000 15.400000 19.300000 3.300000   75% 2.400000 0.320000 25.400000 59.400000 0.400000 31.900000 51.300000 18.400000   max 136.200000 12.700000 562.000000 810.900000 23.400000 262.400000 865.500000 763.800000     We can immediately notice negative measurements for all pollutants. This is not a good sign, because while this can be easily addressed and fixed, it increases our suspicion of more serious problems in the dataset that would be difficult to identify.\nBut that will be addressed later. Now we have to solve the issue of negative measurements. Let\u0026rsquo;s first understand the extent of the problem:\npercent_negative = 100*(df_aqm[pollutants] \u0026lt; 0).mean(axis=0).values print(f'{pollutants[percent_negative.argmax()]} has {percent_negative.max():.1f}% negative values')  NO has 8.8% negative values  That\u0026rsquo;s quite bad. Two of the simplest ways to fix this issue are:\n Clip the negative values to 0 Replace them with NaNs  However, these two approaches may or may not be the best thing to do, depending on:\n The mechanism that has caused this issue The quality of data required to answer the research question  Since I don\u0026rsquo;t have a substantiated answer to any of these questions, I tried to find out what domain practitioners recommend on doing. Here is a thread with some opinions and insights on the matter. The authors propose to differentiate between two situations, and act accordingly:\n If the datapoints exhibit sudden short drops below 0, this probably indicates an instrument malfunction. In this case, it is advised to replace the invalid value with an average of some neighborhood. If consecutive values below 0 are recorded for long times compared to the instrument\u0026rsquo;s integration time, this is probably rooted in the true air conditions. In this case, negative values imply that the real value was below the instrument\u0026rsquo;s detection limit. The suggested approach would be to replace the negative values with the known detection limit, or 0 if it isn\u0026rsquo;t known (like in our case). More justifications for this approach can be found in Polissar et al, 1998  If we want to follow these guidelines, we need to decide for each negative measurement if it the former case or the latter. This will be coded at a later stage.\nChecking for systematic data collection flaws It is important to make sure that our dataset does not have any systematic flaws in the data collection process. For example, later we would like to demonstrate the fluctuations of pollutants as function of the weekday. In this case, if some days are recorded significantly less often than other days, any conclusion we would like to state as for the weekday trend might be invalidated.\nAn easy way to check this is to print the value counts of the weekdays:\ndf_aqm['Weekday Name'] = df_aqm.index.day_name() df_aqm['Weekday Name'].value_counts()  Sunday 126420 Saturday 126145 Friday 126144 Monday 126144 Wednesday 126144 Thursday 126144 Tuesday 126144 Name: Weekday Name, dtype: int64  We see that the dataset is pretty much balanced in terms of weekday logging, and that is reassuring. However, it could also be that the logging system simply adds an entry for every 5-minute interval, while the measurement instruments malfunction with some systematic (i.e not at random) pattern. A complete examination would be:\ndf_aqm[pollutants].isna().groupby(df_aqm['Weekday Name']).mean()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO   Weekday Name             Friday 0.731030 0.271008 0.100235 0.892718 0.040160 0.061295 0.061430 0.061430   Monday 0.731204 0.394097 0.094646 0.887097 0.046114 0.067835 0.068121 0.068398   Saturday 0.730992 0.344128 0.100820 0.894621 0.043846 0.064632 0.064767 0.064767   Sunday 0.734813 0.313724 0.100791 0.884710 0.046757 0.060141 0.060354 0.060354   Thursday 0.728350 0.297026 0.093805 0.892662 0.043442 0.062254 0.062571 0.062579   Tuesday 0.733376 0.305429 0.084047 0.886312 0.043363 0.069159 0.069413 0.069413   Wednesday 0.729674 0.302345 0.084071 0.889745 0.041334 0.059353 0.059559 0.059559     We see that the fraction of missing data changes significantly from one pollutant to another. In addition, for each pollutant, the fraction of missing values changes per weekday, but for now it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say if these differences are consequential. Meanwhile, it\u0026rsquo;s good to keep this table in mind, and we might return to it depending on the analysis and inference that we would like to conduct.\nSo we can conclude this step with the reassurance that the data does not exhibit major systematic data collection flaws, and we can move on in to the analysis. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the data in its most raw form - just a scatterplot of every datapoint:\naxes=df_aqm[pollutants].plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2');  We can notice a few things from this plot:\n PM10 and SO2 are not continuously monitored along the 8 year period. Plots and analyses in the following will not ignore them, as we can still draw some conclusions using these limited measurements We can see the first hint of a seasonal trend: it seems like NOx and NO follow an annual trend. Because of the scatterplot\u0026rsquo;s density it could also be that only a few outliers paint a picture that looks like an annual trend, while in reality they do not contribute a significant amount to the total trend. Therefore a more detailed analysis is required to validate this claim It seems like NO2 and NOx are identical (or almost identical measurements). Reading about NOx it seems rather amusing, as NOx is defined as the sum the nitrogen oxides NO and NO2. But it is the visualization that is misleading, and a closer look reveals that NOx is always higher than NO2.  Let\u0026rsquo;s see if on average there is a real annual trend for some substances:\nlog_interval = 5 # minutes samples_per_week = int(60 / log_interval * 24 * 7) window = samples_per_week*4 overlap = int(2*samples_per_week) df_aqm.rolling( window=window, center=False, min_periods=samples_per_week).mean()[samples_per_week*2::overlap].plot( marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2');  This plot shows rolling averages of the measurements, with windows of 4 weeks and an overlap of 2 weeks. A similar result could be obtained using a simple groupby with a monthly frequency:\ndf_aqm.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='M')).mean()\nBut the overlapping windows add a degree of smoothing which is (arguably) preferable in this case.\nIf you are disappointed too with pandas\u0026rsquo; lack of an overlap parameter in the rolling function, you can contribute to the discussion here.\nAnyway, enough with the ranting. The above plot shows that all nitrogen oxide measurements (and also benzene to a lesser extent) follow a clear annual trend peaking at winter. It is still not clear what\u0026rsquo;s the cause of this modulation, and we will revisit it later in the analysis.\nThe same trends could be demonstrated using a different visualization, plotting the 8 year daily averages of every pollutants.\ndf_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.dayofyear).mean().plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2'); plt.xlabel('Day of the Year');  The annual trend of NO, NO2, NOx and benzene is validated through this plot. In addition, we can notice a peculiar drop in CO values around day 240. A closer look reveals that this drop is at day 243. This day is August 31st, the last day of summer vacation for 1.5 million kids. Coincidence? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What do you think?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move now to a weekly analysis:\nax = sns.boxplot(data=df_aqm, x='Weekday Name', y='NOX', order=['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'], palette=sns.cubehelix_palette(7, start=.5, rot=-.75, dark=0.3, reverse=True)).set_ylim([0,70]);  For NOx, there is a clear weekly trend in the amount of air pollution measured. Note that the outliers have been cropped out of the plot. For other pollutants, the trend is not as impressive:\nax = sns.boxplot(data=df_aqm, x='Weekday Name', y='CO', order=['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'], palette=sns.cubehelix_palette(7, start=.5, rot=-.75, dark=0.3, reverse=True)).set_ylim([0,1]);  And we also see the discrete nature of the CO measurements, as noted earlier. Another way to look at the weekly flactations would be to plot the raw measurements for a specific period of time:\ndf_sub = df_aqm.loc['2019-07':'2019-09'] fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,5)) ax.plot(df_sub.groupby(df_sub.index.date).median()['NOX'], marker='o', linestyle='-') ax.set_ylabel('NOx [ppb]') ax.set_title('') ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.WeekdayLocator(byweekday=mdates.SATURDAY)) ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%b %d'));  For this 3-month period, the lowest measured values were always on Saturdays, agreeing with the boxplot above.\nThe third and last seasonal trend to be analyzed is the dependence on the hour of the day.\ndf_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.time).mean().plot(marker='.', alpha=0.5, linestyle='None', figsize=(11, 11), subplots=True, colormap='Dark2'); plt.xticks([\u0026quot;08:00\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;12:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;16:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;20:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;00:00\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;04:00\u0026quot;]);  Some notes about this plot:\n Most pollutants peak in the morning. Some right at the rush hour (CO, NO, NO2, NOX, Benzene) and some a bit later (SO2, PM10) It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like PM2.5 adheres to any logical pattern. CO peaks around midnight. It seems as it has a slow buildup process, followed by a slow decreasing phase. If nitrogen oxides are caused mainly by transportation, then the rush hour attribution above could make sense. In this case, we could also attribute the slow increase and plateau in the afternoon/evening to the fact (or assumption?) that commute back home is spread on longer hours, compared to the narrow rush hour. I\u0026rsquo;m no expert on the sources of each pollutant, be it transportation, industry, the port or natural factors. So I don\u0026rsquo;t know if any of these hypotheses make any sort of sense.  Air pollution and temperatures The above trends show a clear correlation between the season/month and the average measured pollutants (at least for nitrogen oxides and benzene). But what is the cause of this modulation - is it the time itself? Or maybe it is the temperature? There could be many potential causes, and estimating each of these effects is a difficult problem, according to the identification strategies of causal inference. Instead, we can choose to stay in the realm of mere correlations, and while they do not imply causation, we could speculate what is a reasonable claim and what is not.\nA simple examination would be to evaluate how much of this modulation is governed by the change in temperature (disregarding the day of the year). To this end, I downloaded a second dataset, this time from Israeli Meteorological Service. It includes daily measurements (low and high temperatures) from the meteorological station closest to the air quality monitoring station, situated at BAZAN Group\u0026rsquo;s plant in Haifa.\nA straightforward cleaning yields a dataset that looks like this:\ndf_temp = pd.read_csv('Data/ims_data.csv', sep=\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, encoding=\u0026quot;ISO-8859-8\u0026quot;) # translate df from Hebrew df_temp = df_temp.rename(columns={'משתנה': 'variable', 'תאריך': 'DateTime', 'חיפה בתי זיקוק (600)': 'value'}) df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מינימום(C°)', 'variable'] = 'min temp' df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מקסימום(C°)', 'variable'] = 'max temp' df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'טמפרטורת מינימום ליד הקרקע(C°)', 'variable'] = 'ground temp' # Delete the record 'ground temp' (first make sure it's empty) assert(df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'ground temp','value'].values == '-').all() df_temp = df_temp.drop(df_temp[df_temp['variable'] == 'ground temp'].index) # Convert to datetime df_temp['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df_temp['DateTime'],infer_datetime_format=True) df_temp['value'] = df_temp['value'].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce') df_temp.tail()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  variable DateTime value     8638 min temp 2020-04-27 11.6   8640 max temp 2020-04-28 23.2   8641 min temp 2020-04-28 11.0   8643 max temp 2020-04-29 22.9   8644 min temp 2020-04-29 17.1     Let\u0026rsquo;s plot a histogram of the daily lows and highs, just to see that the dataset makes sense (it does):\ng = sns.FacetGrid(df_temp, hue='variable', height=6) g.map(sns.distplot, 'value', bins=30, hist=True, kde=False, hist_kws={\u0026quot;linewidth\u0026quot;: 3, \u0026quot;alpha\u0026quot;: 0.7}) g.add_legend(title=' ') g.axes[0,0].set_title(\u0026quot;Distribution of minimal and maximal temperatures\u0026quot;) g.axes[0,0].set_xlabel('Temperature [Celsius]');  To merge (fuse?) the datasets, we need to calculate an aggregate value for the pollutants for each day (because temperatures are measured only once a day). Averaging the measurements of each day is the simplest thing to do.\ndf_pol_day = df_aqm.groupby(df_aqm.index.date).mean() df_pol_day.index = pd.to_datetime(df_pol_day.index) df_max = df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'max temp', ['DateTime', 'value']] df_max.rename(columns={'value': 'max temp'}, inplace=True) df_max.set_index('DateTime', inplace=True, drop=True) df_min = df_temp.loc[df_temp['variable'] == 'min temp', ['DateTime', 'value']] df_min.rename(columns={'value': 'min temp'}, inplace=True) df_min.set_index('DateTime', inplace=True, drop=True) df_pol_temp = df_pol_day.merge(right=df_max, how='inner', left_index=True, right_index=True) df_pol_temp = df_pol_temp.merge(right=df_min, how='inner', left_index=True, right_index=True) df_pol_temp.tail()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  SO2 Benzene PM2.5 PM10 CO NO2 NOX NO max temp min temp     2020-04-25 0.031802 0.049213 10.824653 NaN 0.279152 1.761702 1.509220 0.010284 22.3 17.1   2020-04-26 0.089753 0.036250 9.450694 NaN 0.295406 6.074823 7.617376 1.686170 23.0 16.1   2020-04-27 0.217314 0.079306 12.359028 NaN 0.310247 18.504255 28.706383 10.386525 23.0 11.6   2020-04-28 0.595760 0.091632 13.841319 NaN 0.332155 17.207801 26.422340 9.412057 23.2 11.0   2020-04-29 0.102827 0.020035 10.708333 NaN 0.260777 1.787943 1.271986 0.000000 22.9 17.1     sns.jointplot(x='min temp', y='NOX', data=df_pol_temp, kind=\u0026quot;reg\u0026quot;, stat_func=corr_coef); warnings.filterwarnings(action='default')  With a significant correlation of -0.58, the measured NOx values can be explained to some degree by the temperatures. It would be interesting to see if other meteorological factors, like humidity and wind, can explain even more of the NOx fluctuations.\nClosing remarks This notebook described a preliminary exploration of the air quality monitoring data in Haifa. It is by no means an exhaustive analysis, it is just a set of steps used to increase the understanding of the dataset. If you have any comment - an analysis that you think should be done, a peculiar result that should be examined or anything else - I would love to know!\nThis is not a conclusion, as it is only the start of the analysis. In the next chapter, I will evaluate the causal effect of Haifa\u0026rsquo;s new low emission zone using the synthetic control method.

It turns out that open polls, where voters can see previous votes and their votes are visible to others, have different voting profiles compared to hidden polls. In a recent paper, Zou et al. (2015) show that voters act stratigically in open polls, and this change in behaviour includes:\n Open polls have higher response rates for very popular time slots Open polls have higher response rates for very unpopular time slots The average reported availability is higher in open polls compared to hidden polls  The first point not surprising - responders vote more for the popular time slots either because these alternatives are simply better for most voters, or because they feel the need to be cooperative with the group\u0026rsquo;s choices. The second point however does not make sense at first - why would a repsonder vote for a time slot that is clearly not going to be selected? The authors suggest that this is because voters in open polls have an incentive to appear more cooperative:\n \u0026ldquo;There is an implicit social expectation that every responder will mark as many slots as possible. Therefore a responder in open polls may be motivated to mark more slots. In other words, bearing in mind that other participants can see her name and vote, a participant may want to approve more time slots to appear more cooperative even if they are less convenient for herself.\u0026rdquo;\n The third point is likely a consequence of the first two points.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a typical Doodle poll. It is also available here.\n  What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with that? One might think there\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong that voters in open polls behave differently than in hidden polls. But actually this can have a substantial negative impact on the quality of the selected time: Alrawi et al. (2016) argue via a theoretical welfare analysis that when voters are being more generous with their time, this can lead to inferior time slots being selected.\nWhat can be done? While we can\u0026rsquo;t change human nature, we can come up with suggestions for models and algorithms that would cancel out the social bias. Since hidden polls have a higher chance of maximizing social utility, these algorithms should approximate what voting profile would have been recorded if the poll had been hidden. In this short project, a collaboration with Bar Eini-Porat, we propose a simple solution to this problem. This notebook desribes the data and simulation we rely on, details the design considerations we faced, and shows the results of our suggested approach.\nOutline The rest of this notebook is organized as follows. First the dataset of Doodle polls is presented. Then the process of simulating synthetic open polls from real hidden polls is described, followed by detail about the debiasing model. The notebook concludes with results and a discussion on limitations and future directions.\nDataset The data used for this project is a small slice of the dataset that was introduced in Reinecke et al. (2013). The original dataset, provided by Doodle, consisted of 1,771,430 anonymized date/time polls that were selected at random from a time period in mid-2011. Like Zou et al. (2015), we focus our analysis on polls with at least three participants, at least four time slots and only yes/no options. Unlike Zou et al. (2015), we analyze Doodle polls from all around the world, and use only hidden polls for our analysis. The obtained dataset consists of 104 polls and has a median of 9 responders and 10 time slots.\nSimulating open polls from hidden polls The foundamental problem of causal inference is what makes the problem of evaluating a proposed solution so difficult. Meaning we never have access to the two parallel worlds of both an open poll and a hidden poll describing the same scheduling problem with the same group of people. Following Alrawi et al. (2016), we treat the hidden polls of the dataset as ground truth: In a hidden poll each participant casts a vote based solely on their true availability, without introducing social considerations. This is the reason we chose to use only the hidden polls of the dataset.\nFrom each hidden poll we simulate an open poll using the following approach. We keep the number of participants and the number of time slots unchanged. The first voter (usually the poll initiator) is not affected by social considerations, so her approved time slots are unaltered in the simulated open poll compared to the original hidden poll. As for the next responders, their approved time slots may change according to the poll\u0026rsquo;s history up until their vote.\nIn more detail, the simulation process consists of a three-step mechanism:\n  Generate individual utilities\nAn individual utility $u_{ij}$ with $0 \\leq u_{ij} \\leq 1$ is assinged to each voter $v_i$ for each time slot $a_j$ indicating her valuation of attending the meeting or event during that time slot. These utilities are called \u0026lsquo;individual\u0026rsquo; as they are not affected by other voters. We assume that there is a global, fixed \u0026lsquo;yes-threshold\u0026rsquo; $\\tau_1$ that represents the utility beyond which a voter “typically” votes yes, so each voter $v_i$ is expected to say yes to a time slot $a_j$ when her utility for that slot satisfies $u_{ij} \\geq \\tau_1$. Then, in order to comply with the hidden poll, we generate individual utilities greater then $\\tau_1$ for the approved votes in the original hidden poll, and smaller then $\\tau_1$ for the disapproved votes:\n  $$u^{ind}(a) \\sim U[\\tau_1,1] \\text{ for } a \\in A_1$$\n$$u^{ind}(a) \\sim U[0,\\tau_1] \\text{ for } a \\notin A_1$$\nWhere $A_1$ is the set of approved time slots for a voter in the original hidden poll.\n Generate social utilities\nLike in the case of the individual utilities, social utilities are generated for each voter and time slot in each poll. The social utilities reflect the behavioral difference between hidden and open polls, i.e. they will be a function of the popularity of the time slot. Time slot popularity is defined as the ratio between approved votes to total number of votes.\nIn addition, although it was not discussed in Zou et al. (2015), we believe that the social utilities should also depend on the relative poll position, i.e. the fraction of the current voter to the total number of poll participants. For example, the second voter is less affected by social bias compared to the 10th voter. Since we do not have an accurate measure of the magnitude of the strategic behavior described in Zou et al. (2015), we set this magnitude so that it will comply with the increase in average availability in open polls compared to hidden polls (from 0.53 to 0.39, see section 2.3 of Zou et al. (2015)).\nApart from the magnitude of the social effect, we also need to set a functional form for it. We propose a sigmoidal-shaped curve for the social utility as function of popularity. This is an asymmetrical gain-gain function that outputs an unpopularity-gain for values below some neutral popularity and a popularity gain for values above it. Similarly, we propose a sigmoidal-shaped curve for the social utility as function of relative position.\nThe next figure illustrates these functions. The dashed vertical line denotes the neutral popularity, it need not be set at 0.5.\n    The social utility as function of both popularity and relative position is the product of the above two functions, scaled down by a factor representing the maximal possible social utility.\nGenerate approved time slots  Finally, an open poll is deterministically simulated from the hidden poll and generated utilities in accordance with the social voting model of Zou et al. (2015):\n$$\\text{Approve } { A_1^n,A_2^n \\cap Popular, A_2^n \\cap Unpopular }$$\nAccording to this model, there are three preference levels. A voter approves all of her most preferred slots, irrespective of their popularity. In addition, among the slots at her second preference level, the voter approves those slots that are either very popular or very unpopular. No slot of the third preference level is approved. $\\tau_1$ is the decision boundry between $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $\\tau_2$ is the decision boundry between $A_2$ and $A_3$.\nTherefore, approved votes in the synthetic open poll will be those exceeding the individual threshold (those approved in the original hidden poll), or those that, together with the social utilities, exceed the threshold: \\begin{align*} a: u^{ind}(a) \u0026gt; {\\tau_1} ; \\cup ; a: u^{ind}(a)+u^{soc}(a) \u0026gt; {\\tau_{1}} \\end{align*}\nAn important note is that the magnitude of the social effect should not exceed the difference between the thresholds of the preference groups: \\begin{align*} \\text{Maximal Social Utility} \\leq \\tau_1+\\tau_2 \\end{align*} This assures that time slots in the least preferred level ($A_3$) will not be approved, regardless of the social effect.\nDebiasing the open polls Now that we have simulated open polls, we can propose a method for circumventing the social effect. Our debiasing strategy is also a three-step process. First, we attempt to recover the social utilities that were in play for each voter and time slot. Then, we use these social utilities to weight the approved votes, with weight representing vote genuinity (a genuine vote is one that would have been approved irrespective of social considerations). Finally, we aggregate the weights to declare a winning time slot.\nIn more detail:\n  Estimate social utilities\nIn this step the social utility as function of popularity and relative position is estimated. We assume that both the functional form and social effect magnitude are known to us. This is a realistic scenario, as these quantities can be estimated efficiently from a large dataset. Computationally, this is equivalent to the first step of the simulation process. However, in the simulation process the utilities are calculated based on the ground-truth hidden poll, and here the social utilities are estimated based on the open poll history, which is itself biased from the ground-truth.\n  Calculate weights\nIn this step, we weight the voters according to the probability that their votes are genuine. Our weighting mechanism is tightly related to the estimated social utilities. It is defined as follows, where $\\hat{S_{ij}}$ are the estimated social utilities, $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter and $W_{ij}$ are the weights: $$ W_{ij} = 1-\\alpha \\cdot \\hat{S_{ij}} \\text{ for } \\alpha \u0026lt; 1 $$\n  Declare winning time slot\nThe final step is to declare a winning time slot, aggregating information from the calculated weights. We want to minimize the risk that we falsely disapprove a vote that was actually approved in the hidden poll. We can fallback to the Doodle default algorithm (labelled DDA) and choose the most popular time slot whenever we are not confident with our approach.\nWe define the DDA score to be number of votes for each time slot. We define the debiased score to be the sum of weights for each time slot. The DDA winner and debiased winner are the maximal scoring time slot in each scoring regime.\nWe choose to output a winner according to the reweighting mechanism only in cases with relatively high confidence: We recommend the highest scoring alternative in our model only in cases witg substantial score difference. Our final winning candidate for the open poll is defined as:\n$\\text{if DDA score - debiased score} \\geq \\beta \\cdot \\text{debiased score:} $\n$\\text{ final winner} = \\text{DDA winner}$\n$\\text{else final winner} = \\text{debiased winner}$\n  Results The proposed method\u0026rsquo;s performance is evaluated in the following manner. For each poll, there are four possible scenarios:\n The winner in the original hidden poll matches both the winner proposed by DDA and the winner proposed by our method in the simulated open poll and. The winner in the original hidden poll does not match neither the winner proposed by DDA nor the winner proposed by our method in the simulated open poll and. The winner in the original hidden poll matches the winner proposed by DDA, but does not match the winner proposed by our method. The winner in the original hidden poll does not match the winner proposed by DDA, but matches the winner proposed by our method.  We count the number of polls in each of the above cases. We define the method\u0026rsquo;s benefit as the difference between the number of polls in case 4 and the number of polls in case 3. A positive benefit means that our method yields more good than harm.\nFollowing is a summary of obtained benefits as function of the number of voters and the number of time slots. It is apparent that the proposed method yields positive outcomes only in cases with a relatively high number of voters and time slots.\n  If the method is restricted to these cases only, we obtain the following statistics:\n  Which means that it is possible to devise a new voting rule that has a strictly positive benefit. Discussion, limitations and future work This notebook demonstrated a simple proof of concept to circumvent some of the adverse effects of the social voting phenomenon. Of course, further discussion about the work\u0026rsquo;s limitations is warranted.\nFirst, these results have limited statistical validity, as they are constrained by the small dataset available to us. Even though each hidden poll was used to construct many open polls, the effective sample size is still limited to the number of original hidden polls. To alleviate this obstacle, we have also implemented a completely synthetic simulation that does not require real hidden polls. But since these simulated hidden polls are of questionable quality compared to the real world distribution, we found it hard to draw inferences based on them instead of the real data.\nSecond, the whole simulation and analysis environment lacks in external validity. The predictive ability of retrospective analyses is inherently problematic, and to make valid inferences, a true randomized controlled experiment would be required.\nTo conclude, while further investigation is recommended, this work demonstrated the potential for a simple voting rule to increase overall social welfare.\nReferences Alrawi, D., Anthony, B.
